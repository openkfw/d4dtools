Cameras are manual or automatic optical instruments to capture static   and omnidirectional photos, virtual reality or videos. Collaboration platforms are software applications designed   to optimize the interactions or \"group processes\" for people working on a common task. Crowdsourcing can be used to quickly collect up-to-date information from many individuals at relatively low cost, especially from target groups. Drones can be helpful in providing aerial imagery for monitoring   agriculture, wildlife, the environment, and infrastructure. eLearning tools are primarily web-based software to deliver training   and content across a variety of electronic devices. Geospatial tools are designed to collect,  istore, edit, manipulate and analyze different types of geospatial data in layers of  maps. Maintenance Management Systems  are used to manage maintenance operations and optimize the utilization and availability of equipment and infrastructure. Mobile Data Collection tools are used for collecting information from the field via mobile devices such as a smart-phones, tablets, or GPS trackers. Remote anagement Information Systems are useful for tracking infrastructure quality and the progress of complex projects. Earth Observation via satellites is a discipline that allows us to gather   information about our planet.    A sensor is a device that monitors changes by converting signals continuously and automatically from analog objects into a digital interface ."},{"location":"contributing/","title":"Welcome to d4dtools contributing guide","text":"<p>Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

It is used to collaborate on a coherent set of digital representations of an asset\u2019s characteristics. It forms the basis  for the consistent generation and management of information and data relevant to an asset\u2019s lifecycle. In essence, BIM software is a set of integrated computer-added files that can be  extracted, exchanged, and amended to support decision-making regarding a built asset from its planning to its dismantling. The goal is improved building performance combined with transparent communication.

Users     typically access the tool through a web browser (of any     internet-connected device) using a username and password instead of     installing the software. Advantages are access from anywhere to     sophisticated apps without deployment, interoperability     development and maintenance costs (per device), and pay-per-usage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Self-hosting is a more hands-on approach that keeps the application     on one's own (virtual) private server (VPS).

Advantages are data     ownership and security with end- to-end encryption, centralization     of all collaboration tools on one server, and competitive features.     An open-source collaboration software is available to everyone, in     some cases for free; its code can be changed and distributed to     anyone, meaning it has limited warranty. The advantage lies in its     limitless customization possibilities and low-cost distribution     and responsive support thanks to a committed community.</p> </li> <li> <p>Proprietary software cannot be owned since its code is kept     closed-source by providers and distribution or modification is     prohibited. However, its usage can be rented and is limited by an     agreement. The advantage lies in the reliability and compatibility     of its features, but the user can be dependent on the provider's     willingness to upgrade, develop, and maintain the software.

RADAR images contain     complementary information to optical imagery especially in     atmospheric conditions of quasi-permanent cloud cover in some     regions of the world.
