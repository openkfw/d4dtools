# Mobile tools

## Short overview
------

### General Description

The recent and fast development of wireless connection and portable computing devices such as mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets (summarized as mobile tools) enabled users to access and analyse data without having a fixed location. The introduction of this technology created opportunities for multiple applications, including:

- **Mobile data collection tools**, using the potential of mobile devices to collect data through online surveys, field work and synchronization of data collected offline, or integration with sensors such as GPS and cameras. Mobile tools allow for data collection in places that are difficult to access, including risk-prone areas (See also [Mobile Data Collection Tools](../../mdc.md))
- **Crowdsourcing tools**, which use the intelligence of large groups of people to gather information or create new solutions for problems. This application of mobile tools can contribute to mapping or problem-solving platforms, for example (see also [Crowdsourcing Tools](../../cst.md))
- **Social media**, which are software applications or websites that allow for communication between people, create networks of users and facilitate the creation and distribution of content among them. There are different types of social networks, which can be divided into the following categories: general (Facebook), specialised (LinkedIn), blogs (Reddit) and media sharing (YouTube, Instagram) ([Bucur et al. 2019](https://www.ceeol.com/search/chapter-detail?id=776335)).
- **Other smartphone applications**, such as different software applications that can be used for data collection, communication and analysis.

### Potential for Climate Change Adaptation

Mobile Tools contribute with gathering, sharing and analysing data related to CCA, which can be geared towards community engagement, data-based decision-making and real-time monitoring. 

- **Real-time data**. Mobile devices can be used for real-time data collection or be used in places that are difficult to access, including data from several simultaneous users. When combined with other technologies, such as internet of things, big data or management information systems, it generates crucial data for monitoring climate-related risks ([Adekola et al. 2022](https://www.doi.org/10.1002/gdj3.156), and identify needed actions ([Sun et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adapen.2022.100111))
- **Community engagement**. Mobile tools are also important for community participation. They enable local communities to monitor impacts and contribute with inputs for solutions ([Tang et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-40902-3_4)). Data provided by users can inform plans and projects. Particularly social media has the potential to foster grassroots participation in the environmental movement and the promotion of knowledge on climate change adaptation ([León et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2022.2077292)).
- **Integration with early warning systems**. Mobile tools can also be part of early warning systems, enabling effective disaster response. They can be used for collecting, assessing and disseminating the data about climate-related risks, such as heat ([Medina et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2024.105208)).

### Potential for Disaster Risk Management

Several apps have been developed to support disaster risk management in all its different stages, including for informing real-time location of individuals, dissemination of pre and post-disaster information, providing emergency communication and making people aware of imminent risks ([Munawar et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.151351); [Budimir et al. 2021](https://www.preventionweb.net/publication/using-mobile-phone-technologies-disaster-risk-management-reflections-shear)).
- The use of social media platforms and other apps can be crucial in disseminating educational materials and increasing public awareness of disaster preparedness and risk reduction during prevention and preparedness phases.

**Post disaster**

- Two main use cases for social media in disaster response are its ability to provide insight into the situation of those affected and the ability to share information with them, which is particularly relevant immediately after a disaster ([Alhaffar et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2023.104096)).
- In the event of a disaster, data analytics can be applied to data collected from mobile devices to update disaster-related data, identify early warning messages and monitor the information shared by the public ([Hunt & Specht 2019](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41018-018-0048-1)). 
- Social media posts can alert responders to the lack of essential supplies for victims or provide insight into the fears of those affected. In addition, officials can update the public’s situational awareness of the current event by sharing important information via apps and other means ([Dong et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-021-04528-9)). 
- Data provided by users of mobile devices can be used to define priorities and plan post-disaster measures ([Hodapp et al. 2013](https://doi.org/10.1145/2498328.2500075); [Goncalves et al. 2014](https://doi.org/10.1109/SysCon.2014.6819235); [Morreale et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1504/IJSSC.2015.070949)).

However, mobile tools tend to be focused on one stage of DRM or one type of hazard, still falling short in addressing systemic risks or providing all the needs in terms of communication, especially considering areas with low coverage or power shortages ([de Corcuera et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01697-2)).

## Application in different climate hazards
------

### Flooding

Devices equipped with GPS and cameras can collect real-time data and citizens can use their devices to report floods and to receive early warnings ahead of a flood. Platforms for crowdsourcing can support mapping flood-affected areas and inform decision-making. Similarly, social sensing through social media posts made during a flood event can be used to create near real-time flood maps ([Arthur et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0189327); [Yang et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTAS.2017.8319086)).

Maps generated with data from citizens can help emergency management to get an accurate picture of a flood situation, which is often lacking. People affected by a flood event use social media to share how they are affected and whether they need help ([Fohringer et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-15-2725-2015); [Huang et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1080/19475683.2018.1450787); [Karmegam et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40677-021-00195-x)). In doing so, they provide valuable information about the water level at their location. Since this information is not provided by sensors, individual observations must be considered unreliable, but multiple observations of a flood event increase the reliability of the information, according to the "wisdom of the crowd" principle ([Eilander et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2016.07.441)).

### Sea level rise

Communities can use crowdsourced data to monitor changes in sea levels and coastal environments ([Harley & Kinsela 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2022.104796); [Papoutsoglou 2022](https://doi.org/10.1145/3487553.3524852)). 
Awareness campaigns and community discussions about sea-level rise impacts and preparedness measures can be facilitated through social media.

- **Making results public**: citizens can be engaged by making model results public. One such example is the Sea level Change portal of NASA ([NASA Sea Level Change Portal n. d.](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/ipcc-ar6-sea-level-projection-tool)).

### Landslide

Field data can be collected using mobile devices, helping to identify areas at risk of landslides ([Anshori et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2022.105073); [Olyazadeh et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-17-549-2017)). Combined with technical assessment, local communities can report early signs of landslides, such as cracks in the ground or unusual water flows. This information, when considered collective observations, can inform early warning systems ([Kocaman & Gokceoglu 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10346-018-1101-2)). 

Social media can also supplement traditional data acquisition methods for landslide detection. For example, the British Geological Survey (BGS) maintains the most comprehensive database of landslide events in the United Kingdom. Data for the National Landslide Database are collected from a variety of sources. Social media is used by the BGS in two ways: to collect data on landslide events through keyword searches, and to communicate landslide information to the public. More than a hundred landslide events per year have been collected using this approach of scanning social media with an improved media search engine by the BGS. The utilisation of social media allows for the capture of factors such as impacts and triggers of landslides during the time of occurrence, which might not otherwise be recorded ([Pennington et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2015.03.013); [Pennington et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.103089)).

Social media can be used to trigger warnings, raise awareness, share evacuation routes, and post updates on landslide-prone areas.

### Water Scarcity/ Drought

Farmers and local communities can use mobile apps to report water levels and soil conditions, aiding in drought monitoring ([Dennis & Dennis 2019](https://www.doi.org/10.2495/WS190101)). Information on water availability and usage can be crowdsourced to plan and manage water distribution or to identify vulnerable areas. 

Social media can have a positive effect on farmer’s adoption of resilience behaviour towards climate change. Membership in social networks and information exchange on extreme climate events can provide farmers with the necessary information to make preventive decisions to mitigate the negative impacts of droughts and protect their livelihood assets ([Bathaiy et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102209)).

- **Crowdsourcing data**: enable citizens to report issues and contribute to corresponding efforts. Reporting leakages is an example.

### Strong Winds/ Storms

Mobile tools can be used to track and document wind damage. Users can contribute near real-time data on strong winds conditions and damage reports, among other data regarding weather conditions ([Niforatos et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1145/2836041.2836056)). An example of the large-scale use of social media in disaster response is Hurricane Harvey, which hit the Gulf of Mexico in 2017. Thousands of rescue processionals helped the people affected by the hurricane through messages posted on social media asking for help ([Marzuoli & Liu 2018](https://doi.org/10.1109/BigData.2018.8622641); [Dong et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11069-021-04528-9); [Mangones 2024](https://preparecenter.org/topic/social-media-disasters/)).

### Forest/ Bush Fires

Mobile devices can be used to map fire perimeters and document vegetation loss in real-time. Contributions from users can help identify the spread of fires and identify most vulnerable areas ([Lane et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-15994-2_15)). Social media can equally be used to detect and map wildfires. Social media posts can alert fire response units to forest or bush fires. Social media can be used to detect and map wildfires. Social media posts can alert fire response units to forest or bush fires ([Li et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.firesaf.2021.103480)).

### Extreme Temperatures

Temperature data and health impacts from extreme temperatures can be collected and analysed via mobile apps ([Johnston et al. 2018](https://www.doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aab1e6)). Communities can report heat or cold stress incidents, contributing to data on vulnerable populations and regions ([Analitis et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1289/isesisee.2018.O04.02.12)). Social media can be used to increase the preparedness and response capacity towards extreme temperature events.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is using social media to spread important safety messages on heat safety before and during heat waves to inform the public and improve the public’s preparedness and response capacity. NOAA encourages social media users to share their heat wave infographics on social media to reach a wider audience ([National Weather Service 2024](https://www.weather.gov/wrn/summer2017-heat-sm#sp1)).

- **Crowdsourcing for data collection**: collect weather and temperature data to inform heatwave alerts and identify hotspots (also see [Meier et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2017.01.006)).

### Subwater Penetration

No specific examples found.

## Application in DRM/ CCA measures
------

### Nature-based solutions

Mobile devices can be used to gather data on the effectiveness of nature-based solutions ([Hill et al. 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbsj.2024.100120)). Devices with GPS help in mapping and monitoring changes in ecosystems, even in remote locations. Volunteers can use mobile apps to report on the condition of natural habitats, invasive species, or the success of nature-based solutions measures ([Graham et al. 2011](https://doi.org/10.1029/2011EO380002); [Adriaens et al. 2015](https://www.doi.org/10.3391/mbi.2015.6.2.12); [Howard et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.3897/neobiota.71.79597)). Moreover, awareness campaigns about the benefits of nature-based solutions and community participation can be promoted through social media.

An example of the use of social media can be found in China. In response to the loss of natural wetlands, nature-based solutions have been proposed to compensate for this loss and reduce vulnerability. This has led to the creation of hundreds of wetland parks. Researchers employed social media (i.e. Sina Weibo) to obtain a large quantity of data on the public discourse on wetland parks, to close a gap of understanding of public perception of the ecosystem services provided by wetland parks. They conducted an analysis of microblogs to understand the public perception in Guangzhou, and compared these with those communicated by professional institutions. This example shows that social media can be used to understand the public perception of nature-based solutions, which can help to better align the implementation and management of projects using nature-based solutions ([Xuezhu et al. 2020](https://www.doi.org/10.15302/J-LAF-1-020030)).

### Integrated Coastal Zone Protection

Field surveys can be conducted using mobile tools to gather data on coastal erosion, mangrove health to assess NbS functions, and sea-level rise impacts, among others. Local communities can provide near real-time data on changes in coastal areas and help in response and long-term planning ([Papoutsoglou 2022](https://doi.org/10.1145/3487553.3524852)).

### Stormwater Management

Mobile tools can monitor and collect data on rainfall and water quality ([Champanis et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1145/2160673.2160688); [Burkard et al. 2017](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-89935-0_11)). Sensors integrated with mobile devices can provide real-time data on water flow and levels. Citizens can report flooding incidents and other stormwater-related issues using their mobile devices ([Naik 2016](https://doi.org/10.1109/SysEng.2016.7753186); [Verbeiren et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-99867-1_114)). Information on stormwater management practices, community initiatives, and real-time updates during storm events can be shared through social media. Social media can be used to inform users on rainwater harvesting practices, which is an important solution to drinking water scarcity. Educational posts on social media can create awareness to the solution of rainwater harvesting and can provide citizens with guidance for harvesting rain water themselves ([Karthick et al. 2019](https://www.doi.org/10.35940/ijrte.B1125.0782S619); [Suits et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.3390/w15081623)).

### Waste Management

The utilisation of social media can facilitate the adoption of more environmentally conscious attitudes ([Wamuyu 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.03.029)). Social networks have the potential to increase citizens’ environmental awareness and influence their behaviour by effectively promoting waste management services and recycling scheme ([Jiang et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2020.105146)). Waste management services can benefit from an increased public awareness and better recycling behaviour, making their operations more efficient.

## Relevance Within the Project Cycle
------

Mobile tools can be most helpful during project implementation, verification and review phases.

**Project Preparation:** 
During the preparation phase it is most important to plan for future use and collection of mobile data to fully unlock its potential. Available data e.g. from crowdsourcing or target group surveys using mobile applications might inform the project design.

**Project Implementation:**
Mobile tools can be used for stakeholder engagement and data collection throughout implementation.  The implementation of (new) mobile tools can also be part of the project itself. 

**Verification and Project Progress:**
Secondary data from mobile tools can support progress monitoring, including to complement data from project sources or to compare and validate as needed. Use of data from mobile applications will require awareness of potential biases towards mobile device users. Social media can help to assess satisfaction and critique related to the project and inform development of related measures as needed. 

**Final Project Review:**
Data from mobile tools can inform the project review and complement other data sources.

**Ex-Post Evaluation:** 
Available data from mobile sources can be used for evaluations if potential biases are considered accordingly. Established community engagement formats can facilitate collecting stakeholder data for assessments.

## Technology Requirements
------

For the successful application technical, methodological and contextual requirements must be met. 

**Technical & methodological requirements**

- Mobile computing relies on adequate portable devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, smartwatches, among others. The specification of the portable device depends on the needs of the project, such as weight, screen size, computing capacity, costs etc.
- Like other digital solutions, mobile tools require a stablished physical infrastructure, including web and database servers to handle requests and store data. Users need wireless connectivity to access and analyse data, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and cellular networks (3G, 4G, 5G). Depending on the application, data can be collected offline and later be synchronized. 
- Another technical component is the software. Mobile tools usually require applications (apps) to undertake the different tasks. A wide range of mobile applications are already available for different purposes, including mapping, surveying, and communication. Apps can also be specifically designed to address a specific task, requiring more effort of development. It is also important to note that apps are usually tailored to operate efficiently on mobile devices, and this might imply challenges in terms of interoperability between different operating systems or devices.
- The data production is carried out by the users of mobile devices and, in the case of crowdsourcing or social media for example, users voluntarily provide their data by sharing it on adequate platforms ([Pérez-delHoyo et al. 2018](https://www.doi.org/10.2495/UG180161)). This generates a large amount of data that may require adequate methods to be used. Data mining may be necessary whenever the data has not been directly shared with a city’s server or storage unit, while, once available, it needs be analyzed. Both require expertise and resources.
 
**Context requirements**

- There are also knowledge and legal frameworks requirements for mobile tools to operate. Users need digital skills in the form of basic digital literacy and platform-specific knowledge to use mobile tools. 
- Depending on the type of data that is collected or shared, adequate legal frameworks must be in place to protect users and their privacy. This applies specially to social media, but it is also a concern regarding any practice of data collection and crowdsourcing that require informed consent. Compliance of mobile tools with national data protection laws is another legal requirement.

For tool(s) selection/design we therefore recommend using the [KfW Digital Rights Check](https://digitalrights-check.bmz-digital.global/kfw/).

## Legal Aspects
------

**Local laws may** restrict collecting, processing, and exporting project-related data due to restrictions on the freedom of speech or restrictions on the use of crowdsourcing software.

**Data protection** issues can arise in connection to the content (e.g. name, picture, opinion relating to specific person) and/or to the technical process of the data transfer (e.g. telephone num- ber). Only strictly relevant personal data should be collected and processed. If initial data minimization is not possible, data must be anonymized (by redaction or pixilation). In case KfW (or persons acting on its behalf) are (also) processing personal data, the privacy check in Section 2.3.1 must be followed.

A Tool must have adequate **security to protect collected personal data**, such as mobile phone numbers and names. Data leaks and security breaches threaten the viability of using crowdsourcing platforms, as participants must trust them.

Flawed or inadequate data security to provide robust data protection puts the human rights of the participants at risk. This particularly applies in countries with limited freedom of opinion where crowdsourcing has the potential to put individuals at risk. In this situation, the privacy/anonymity of the participants should also be established in the Separate Agreement of the project [Section 3.1.4.2 Separate Agreement](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/).

**Data security requirements** can also arise from local data protection regulations and/or the GDPR, which stipulate basic security requirements. Entities may be obliged under those rules to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services.

Controllers of personal data must also apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to satisfy data protection law. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and implemented to meet security principles and to provide adequate safeguards to protect personal data, see [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/).

In case **social media** are being used, the future deletion of the content, including any user data, after the end of the project should be explicitly planned and ensured so that this data cannot be misused later. This applies in particular to personal data but is not limited to it. See also [Crowdsourcing Tools](../../cst.md)

## Summary assessment
------

### Overall Effectiveness

Mobile tools, including smartphones, tablets, and other portable devices, have changed urban resilience by enabling real-time data collection, analysis, and communication. They can enhance urban areas' capacity to anticipate, respond to, and recover from disasters. Their effectiveness results from their ability to provide dynamic, user-generated data, even in remote or hazardous locations, through GPS, sensors, and user inputs. The integration of crowdsourcing allows for the aggregation of diverse data inputs, enhancing the reliability of observations. Social media platforms foster grassroots participation, enabling citizens to share observations, report risks, and co-create solutions. They can also facilitate emergency communication, provide situational updates, and guide response efforts.

### Overall Efficiency

Mobile tools can be an efficient solution due to their affordability, accessibility, and scalability, making them viable in both high- and low-resource settings. The widespread ownership of mobile devices democratizes data collection and decision-making, enabling diverse communities to participate in resilience-building efforts. Additionally, these tools can be deployed in various contexts, from small-scale local initiatives to global monitoring systems. The integration of mobile tools with technologies like artificial intelligence and IoT enhances their functionality. Mobile tools also play a critical role in information sharing and stakeholder coordination, particularly during emergencies when real-time communication is essential.

Social networks serve as an interactive platform for coordinating efforts and communicating with a diverse range of stakeholders, regardless of geographical or socio-economic boundaries. Social media provides citizens with a platform to build awareness and facilitate collective activism ([Cai and Marks 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2021.101019)).

Despite their strengths, mobile tools face challenges that can limit their efficiency. Inadequate infrastructure, low network coverage, and power shortages remain significant barriers, especially in resource-constrained or remote areas. If this backbone infrastructure is not yet implemented, the application of mobile tools remains costly and with reduced efficacy. Furthermore, while crowdsourcing utilizes the "wisdom of the crowd" to gather data, individual observations often require validation through triangulation or statistical methods to ensure reliability.

### Key Challenges and Limitations

**Connectivity.** One of the main limitations in the use of mobile tools is its dependence on connectivity. In disaster scenarios or remote areas, connectivity may be limited or unreliable.  In these cases, using off-line applications is an alternative but it hinders the capacity of having near real-time data.

**Reliability of crowdsourced data.** Crowdsourced data can be biased, replicate misinformation or lead to mistakes when users do not input information properly. It is necessary to ensure the quality of data collected.

**Data security.** Collecting and sharing data through mobile devices can raise concerns about privacy and data security. Users’ personal information can be compromised in digital attacks or leaks, and users are vulnerable to malware and phishing. There is a lack of knowledge among users about the consequences and risks associated with using social media platforms ([AlMudahi et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1109/WiDS-PSU54548.2022.00043)). 

**Digital divide.** Not everyone has access to mobile devices, particularly in low-income or rural areas. Data sourced from mobile tools can reflect inequalities in access to technology and harm or benefit disproportionately different groups and communities. As an example, early adopters of new technologies tend to be wealthier populations who benefit most from the advantages of social media ([Ahamed and Gong 2022](https://doi.org/10.1504/JBM.2022.141296)).

**Misinformation.** A major challenge in social media is the deliberate or unintentional spread of misinformation. Particularly in the case of a disaster event, misinformation can have devastating consequences, as it can mislead people impacted and provide an untrue portrayal of the situation for disaster response. Social media is often the only source of news for many disadvantaged people, who tend to have limited digital literacy. This increases the negative impacts of misinformation on them ([Cai and Marks 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2021.101019)) (For more comprehensive information see [Principles for Digital Development n.d.](https://digitalprinciples.org/), [UN Global Digital Compact n.d.](https://www.un.org/global-digital-compact/en) and [Mejias and Couldry (2024)](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo216184200.html)).

### Recommendations to optimize the use of the digital tool

To maximize the potential of mobile tools, it is essential to address infrastructure gaps by ensuring reliable network coverage and access to power, particularly in remote or resource-limited areas. In areas with unreliable networks, integrating offline functionalities can help maintain data collection; however, this comes at the expense of real-time monitoring. Strategic investments in robust communication infrastructure, such as satellite-based connectivity or portable network solutions, can improve access in remote or disaster-affected regions.

Additionally, ensuring the quality and reliability of crowdsourced data is crucial. Data gathered through mobile tools, especially through crowdsourcing, must be validated to guarantee the accuracy and quality of data. Incorporating validation mechanisms, such as triangulation or statistical methods, is necessary to ensure its reliability for decision-making processes. Equally important is mitigating risks related to data security, misinformation, and the digital divide. Privacy safeguards, such as encryption and anonymized data collection, are essential to protect user information from breaches. The application of mobile tools with a wider public must be followed by awareness campaigns, educating users about the use, opportunities and risks of the proposed solution.

In order to identify and mitigate such human rights risks within KfW-financed projects, we recommend to use the [KfW Human Rights Check for Financial Development Cooperation](https://digitalrights-check.bmz-digital.global/kfw/) during project preparation and implementation.

## Project Examples/ Use Cases

- Citizen Science has gained track in areas relating mobile tools, data collection and monitoring schemes. CoastSnap, a citizen science program to monitor coastlines has shown significant results. It exploits smartphone technology and image processing techniques based on long-term optical remote sensing research ([Harley & Kinsela 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2022.104796)). The program functions by engaging and harnessing citizens willing to contribute to said monitoring through strategically located cradles focused on the beach area to be monitored. It does not require training nor extensive engagement and thus provides a simpler solution to gather a scientifically rigorous dataset of shoreline development. To the date of the publication of its scientific article ([Harley & Kinsela 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csr.2022.104796)), there were 200 stations installed in 21 countries. Given the cost-effective nature of its geographic expansions, it can function as a mobile tool that engages citizens and helps authorities monitor coastal developments. 
- The Provincial Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) for Jakarta has implemented social media into their DRM strategy to enhance urban resilience. The project [*PetaJakarta.org*](https://icos.urenio.org/applications/petajakarta-org/) utilises social media data to gain real-time information. The project is based on the social media platform X (then Twitter), because of the speed of response to natural hazards on the platform and the high user density in the city. During the 2014-15 monsoon season, citizens participated in the project by reporting real-time information about flooding in their area via tagging a specific account. This allowed government agencies to triangulate the information to locate flooding and organise response to the events accordingly. The Provincial Disaster Management Agency for Jakarta also used a Twitter account to disseminate information on imminent disaster risk to the citizens. The project enabled citizens to share information on social media to help government agencies to better understand the situation on the ground and thus enable real-time disaster risk assessments ([Sitinjak et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2018.01.029)).

## Linkages to other Tool Types
------

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Mobile tools can be integrated with AI to automatize operations and customize the user experience. Algorithms can analyse data collected via mobile tools for predictive modelling, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition. Additionally, crowdsourced data can be analysed in real-time to provide immediate insights. When used as data sources, mobile tools can function as input for AI models.
- **Data sources:** Due to mobile tools’ data collection nature, big data technology is frequently used in storing and harmonizing the collected data. Generated data can also be made available as open data.
- **Digital Twins:** Mobile devices can interact with digital twins to provide data or to generate visualizations of specific data coverage patterns. See also [Building Information Modelling](../../bim.md). 
- **Communication and Collaboration:** Mobile tools can facilitate communication and collaboration, enabling distant and emergency communication, as well as e-learning. Mobile tools not only enable e-learning but also offer the opportunity for more personalized formats. See also [Collaboration](../../collaboration.md) and [E-learning tools](../../elearning.md)
- **Earth Observation tools:** Mobile devices can collect geospatial data and inform geospatial models. The portability of mobile tools enables users to cover remote areas. The integration of data from earth observation tools with that collected from mobile devices allows to formulate maps and understand the spatial distribution of data, especially in relation to the built environment. See also [Geospatial tools and GIS](../../gis.md)
- **(Remote) Management Information Systems (MIS):** Mobile tools can provide real-time data for MIS, thereby enhancing decision-making processes. Given the flexibility of mobile devices, such as smartphones, their data can more accurately reflect dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, MIS can be displayed in mobile devices, providing access to information to a wider audience. See also [Management Maintenance Systems (MMS)](../../mms.md) and [(Remote) Management Information Systems](../../rmis.md). 
- **Internet of Things (IoT):** Mobile tools can complement sensors by collecting real-time data. Together, these technologies enable the collection and integration of data into urban analytical models for deeper analysis. See also [Sensors / SmartMeters (Internet of Things)](../../sensors.md)
