# (Remote) Management Information Systems (R/MIS)

## Short overview
------

### General Description

Management Information Systems (MIS) are web-based or desktop software system used to systematically collect, validate, store, manage, monitor, aggregate, process, analyze, visualize, and publish data for monitoring and management purposes ([Shaqiri 2014](https://www.richtmann.org/journal/index.php/ajis/article/view/2943); [Mishra 2013](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2307474)). Frequently, they use real-time indicators to facilitate decision-making. 

R/MIS are usually associated with dashboards that present information for decision-making. **Dashboards** are a key component of R/MIS and enable the visualization of datasets managed within the system. They are the interface with which the user interacts, usually adjusted to their needs and capacities, presenting a selection of data that is relevant for the user or decision-maker. Dashboards can help making sense of large volumes of data and present information that facilitates decision-making [(Beuschel 2008)](https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitlesample.aspx?id=11247&ptid=348&t=dashboards+for+management). 

### Potential for Climate Change Adaptation

In addition to facilitate project management, R/MIS also provide tools for analyzing, monitoring, and responding to climate-related risks [(Constable et al. 2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2022.754264/full), including: 

- **Resource management.** The use of R/MIS can make the use of resources (financial, staff, material and others) and assets more efficient and sustainable.  
- **Vulnerability assessment and scenario modelling.** Using different datasets in an integrated system can help to identify (climate) risk-prone areas and forecast future (climatic) conditions and impacts, allowing to conclude on needed adaptation action.  
- **Data integration.** R/MIS can integrate large volumes of data from different sources, including data collected through other technologies, such as open datasets, mobile tools and internet of things [(Rochon 2008)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-79259-8_5).  
- **Monitoring.** R/MIS can be a key feature in monitoring the implementation of projects and policies. By tracking progress over time, it is possible to assess the efficacy of implemented measures and contribute to a process of evaluation and learning.  
- **Real-time monitoring.** The use of real-time data provided by different sources, including mobile tools and sensors, enables R/MIS to give real-time inputs that are particularly useful for the management of crisis and disasters. This enhances not only preparedness but also the response to disasters. 
- **Awareness.** Information produced by R/MIS can be used in awareness raising campaigns and provide adequate data for governments, NGOs, community-based organisations, among others, to address climate-related challenges.  

### Potential for Disaster Risk Management

The main potential of R/MIS for DRM lays on its capacity to integrate data from different sources and technologies, making sense of it and presenting it in a way that is useful for decision-makers. The creation of a data-rich environment can potentially support more informed decisions in all stages of DRM [(Rochon 2008)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-79259-8_5), including by bringing together data from different hazards. 

R/MIS can be used to identify risk-prone areas and inform taking adequate prevention measures. It enables the assessment of vulnerability by the integration of diverse types of data, such as weather, historical data of disaster occurrence, demographics, socioeconomic profiles, land use, urban planning, geomorphological features etc. MIS integrate these different data sources and allow for an integrated analysis. R/MIS can be integrated into early warning systems and offer inputs and predictive analytics. R/MIS can support the sustainable management of resources and assets, including facilities, personnel, vehicles, equipment etc. A systemic overview of available resources can support better addressing risks. Information produced by R/MIS can inform decision making of different government bodies and other stakeholders, ensuring that actors have a clearer and more coordinated vision of disaster risks [(Comes et al. 2014)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11818-5_16). 

The use of real-time data in R/MIS provides a more comprehensive overview of disasters, which can help making informed decision during a crisis [(Bannour et al. 2018)](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2279/LPKM2018_paper_10.pdf). R/MIS can support coordinate response efforts, through adequate allocation of resources and tracking the progress of response [(Al-Zhrani 2010)](https://thescipub.com/abstract/jcssp.2010.1247.1251). R/MIS can support recovery in presenting the status of affected territories, communities and infrastructure. The system can also be used to track progress in recovery efforts and coordinate measures among different actors. 

## Application in different Climate Hazards
------

### Flooding

R/MIS can be used to monitor water levels and soil saturation, when integrated with other technologies such as sensors and satellite images. The analysis made with R/MIS can feed into predictive models or be integrated into early warning systems to alert authorities and communities when water levels may reach critical thresholds (Mioc et al. 2008). R/MIS can manage data to identify flood-prone areas based on data from different sources, such as remote sensing, GIS, mobile applications and social media [(Makinano-Santillan et al. 2019)](https://isprs-annals.copernicus.org/articles/IV-3-W1/25/2019/). This can be integrated with geospatial tools to generate maps and support planning for urban development or emergency response [(Khan 2013)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257356474_Flood_Prediction_and_Disaster_Risk_Analysis_using_GIS_based_wireless_sensor_NetworksA_Review). 

### Sea Level Rise

R/MIS can integrate historical series of sea level data extracted from different sources, such as sensors, satellite imagery and models. Similarly, as in its use for flooding, R/MIS can contribute to the analysis of vulnerability and risk-prone areas and inform the development of context-specific measures and strategies, such as sea walls and mangrove restoration. The integration of geospatial tools, particularly GIS, is particularly relevant for the development of coastal management systems for climate associated flood risk assessment ([Thumerer et al. 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/136588100240840); [Sahin & Mohamed 2010](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5674432)). 

### Landslide

Sensors that monitor soil moisture, ground movement, and rainfall can feed data into an R/MIS along with geospatial data, providing early warning for landslide risks ([Artha & Julian 2018](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/106/1/012012); [Kebaili et al. 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050916322359)).  The integration of different on-site technologies enables the creation of a site-specific early warning system with high rates of prediction success [(Kuradusenge 2022)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-16-5987-4_86). R/MIS can create landslide susceptibility maps that highlight areas prone to landslides based on geological and environmental factors [(Smarsly et al. 2014)](https://www.ijetch.org/papers/752-T981.pdf). These maps are useful for risk-sensitive urban planning and disaster preparedness. 

### Water Scarcity / Drought

R/MIS can track water availability, usage, and demand across different sectors (e.g. agriculture, industry, domestic). Indiaâ€™s Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) is an example of such application, displaying information on water availability and quality at different scales. The database is used for decision-making in the country, including resource allocation [(Wescoat et al. 2016)](https://iwaponline.com/wp/article/18/4/1015/20517/National-rural-drinking-water-monitoring-progress). 

By integrating data on precipitation, soil moisture, and reservoir levels, R/MIS can monitor drought conditions and provide early warnings. The Global Integrated Drought Monitoring and Prediction System (GIDMaPS) is an example of R/MIS that provides information on drought based on multiple indicators [(Hao et al. 2014)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20141). This enables proactive water conservation measures and drought response plans. R/MIS can also support farmers by providing data on crop water requirements, soil conditions, and weather forecasts, helping them optimize irrigation practices and select drought-resistant crops [(Adeyemi et al. 2017)](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/9/3/353). 

### Strong Winds / Storms

R/MIS can integrate data from weather radars, satellite imagery, and meteorological models to track storms, hurricanes and cyclones, and predict their paths, intensity, and potential impacts [(Hristova-Veleva et al. 2020)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/101/10/BAMSD190020.xml). An example is the Information Management System for Hurricane disasters (IMASH), that coordinates geographically referenced environmental data with intelligent decision support system to support pre- and post-disaster activities [(Iakovou & Douligeris 2001)](https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJRAM.2001.001508). R/MIS can trigger early warnings and guide post-disaster response, coordinating the use of resources. 

### Forest / Bush Fires

R/MIS can identify risk-prone areas, by use of indicators such as humidity levels, temperature and wind speed. The data is fed from different sources, including satellite imagery, sensors and drones, to provide near-real-time information on risks. AEGIS is an example of a Greek web-GIS wildfire prevention and management platform, using spatial and non-spatial data sources to produce simulations and support decision-making [(Kalabokidis et al. 2016)](https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/16/643/2016/nhess-16-643-2016.html). It can also be used as a platform for management and monitoring of recovery efforts, such as reforestation or soil stabilization. 

### Extreme Temperatures

R/MIS can be used to identify temperatures, next to other indicators such as wind or humidity, in both, local and large-scale contexts. Thereby they can be important tools to support predicting and monitoring heatwaves and cold spells. 

### Saltwater Penetration

R/MIS can be used to monitor salinity in water bodies and changes in salinity levels over time, when integrated with other technologies such as sensors. 

## Application in DRM/ CCA Measures
------

### Nature-based Solutions

R/MIS can support the planning and implementation of nature-based solutions by evaluating costs and benefits, and indicating the best locations for interventions, when spatial data is included in the system. Following implementation, R/MIS can monitor the performance of these solutions over time, analysing their effectiveness in reducing disaster risks and enhancing climate resilience. 

### Integrated Coastal Zone Protection

R/MIS can be integrated with sensors and remote sensing technologies to monitor coastal conditions in real time. R/MIS can analyse data on sea level rise, erosion rates, storm patterns, and other relevant indicators to assess vulnerability in coastal zones. It can facilitate the coordination of resources and stakeholders involved in coastal protection projects [(Flagg et al. 2019)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8962781). 

### Stormwater Management

R/MIS can collect and analyse data on precipitation, runoff, and drainage capacity within urban areas. This information helps in understanding the behaviour of stormwater systems and in identifying areas at risk of flooding. R/MIS can support the design and optimization of stormwater management infrastructure and be integrated with weather forecasting and hydrological models to provide early warnings of potential risks. 

### Waste Management

R/MIS can monitor and manage data on waste generation, types of waste, waste collection, and disposal processes. 

## Relevance within the Project Cycle
------

R/MIS can be helpful throughout all phases of project implementation. 

**Project Preparation:**  

R/MIS facilitates the integration of data from different sources and thereby supports designing the best-suited project approach, as well as raising awareness on the need for the project or selected components with decision-makers. 

**Project Implementation:**

R/MIS can be an essential factor for effective use of resources throughout the project, supporting allocation of staff, materials and budgets. That also includes monitoring resource use to make needed adjustments. Furthermore, data integration by R/MIS provides real-time data to monitor project progress. 

**Verification and Project Progress:** 

R/MIS Data can support project impact assessment and reviews by providing aggregated data from different sources, allowing for effective monitoring of progress made and identification of potential obstacles.  

**Final Project Review:**  

Information from R/MIS can be very valuable in project review, to enable it the assurance of keeping the R/MIS accessible until the final review should be included in ToRs of responsible actors. 

**Ex-Post Evaluation:**

R/MIS can provide very relevant information for project evaluation, for example by providing data on effectiveness and impacts of implemented measures. 

## Technology Requirements
------

The application of R/MIS requires an environment with adequate physical conditions, as well as quality data input. 

**Context:** 

- Robust Management Information Systems require servers with performance good enough to host R/MIS application, datasets and to process tasks.  
- Users will need devices adequate to the visualization of the system, including computers, smartphones or tablets. 
- Depending on the level of complexity of the MIS, specialized expertise may be needed to carry out various tasks. This includes not only the development and maintenance of the system itself but also the consistent collection of data that will be fed into the system.  

**Input:** 

- MIS demand solid data input, that is fed into the system in adequate formats and frequency. Therefore, systematized and integrated data collection and data management are essential for the good working of MIS. Data series need to match the demands of the particular application.  

## Legal Aspects
------

**Data Security:** If a desktop software system is used, data security should be warranted by ensuring: 

- that the data are protected against unauthorized or accidental destruction, accidental loss, technical defects, falsification, theft, unlawful use, unauthorized modification or duplication, and other forms of unauthorized access and use by appropriate technical means regular backup of data appropriate security of hardware 
- If the software is provided as a web-based service (SaaS), the provider should be contractually obliged to take appropriate organizational and technical precautions to prevent disruptions to the availability, integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of their IT systems, components, and processes that are essential to the functioning of the critical infrastructures they operate. The provider should implement data backup concepts, thereby ensuring the protection of data against loss due to system-related faults. 

**Data protection:** Wherever possible, the collection of personal data should be avoided. If this is impossible, the main principles of data protection must be adhered to, that is, personal data shall: 

- be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner 
- only be used for a legitimate purpose in relation to the project  
- be limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for the project 
- be accurate and, where necessary, kept up-to-date  
- not be kept longer than is necessary for the purposes of the project 
- be securely stored, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss 

If KfW (or persons acting on behalf of it) are (also) processing personal data, the privacy check in [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/) must be followed. 

As R/MIS and MMS tools allow **tracking of employees**, legal restrictions on the use of such tools may arise from applicable local laws. Some privacy laws will give discretion to employers as to how far they can go with their employee monitoring programs. In other cases, employers will have to inform employees who are likely to be monitored or even require employees to consent. 

In case KfW (or persons acting on behalf of it) are (also) process- ing personal data, the privacy check in [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/) must be followed.

## Summary Assessment
------

### Overall Effectiveness

R/MIS can aid promoting urban resilience by integrating, analysing, and visualizing data for effective decision-making. These systems provide valuable tools for vulnerability assessments, scenario modelling, and real-time monitoring of disaster risks, making them helpful for proactive climate resilience strategies. By aggregating data from various sources, including mobile tools, sensors, and satellite imagery, R/MIS can offer valuable information in an integrated and simple manner. The integration of artificial intelligence and advanced geospatial tools further enhances the systemâ€™s capacity to predict risks, and monitor impacts, including of recovery action. This allows users and decision-makers to take action based on evidence. However, this also depends on the quality of data and how models are built. Biases in the formulation of the system will be reflected in decision-making. 

### Overall Efficiency

The efficiency of R/MIS depends on robust implementation, data quality, and the integration of various technologies. For successful application, R/MIS must be fed with accurate, consistent and continuous data and require high-performance servers, specialized expertise, and user-friendly interfaces. Capacity is key to yield the best results, since the information presented by R/MIS can be complex. It is also relevant for more efficiency, that R/MIS draws on existing systems, infrastructure and available data, avoiding the duplication of costs. In this sense, governance is key to provide coordination and avoid fractured administration of the system. Partnerships between governments, private sector actors, and communities can contribute with maintaining the systemâ€™s adequate to local needs and also benefiting multiple stakeholders at the same time. 

### Key Challenges and Limitations

**Systemic understanding.** The development of the Management Information System depends also on the understanding of the systemic nature of risks. How risk and its effects are analysed by the R/MIS depends on the descriptive model of the system. Moreover, the system is a simplification of reality and may count with uncertainties that are difficult to account for [(Constable et al. 2022)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/climate/articles/10.3389/fclim.2022.754264/full). 

**Misrepresentation.** Research calls attention to the risk of R/MIS misrepresenting reality and leading to harmful decisions, when ignoring contextual factors and uncertainty [(Drummond 2011)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1057/jit.2011.9). R/MIS can also lead to a false impression of complete understanding of the situation. A process of monitoring, evaluation and learning is useful to better calibrate the R/MIS and make climate risk management more efficient and accurate [(Noltze et al. 2021)](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/monitoring-evaluation-and-learning-for-climate-risk-management_58665de0-en). For more comprehensive information on these challenges and limitations, see the [Principles for Digital Development](https://digitalprinciples.org/), the [Global Digital Compact](https://www.un.org/global-digital-compact/en), as well as [Mejias and Couldry (2024)](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo216184200.html). 

### Recommendations to optimize the Use of the Digital Tool

For the effective application of MIS, it is essential to prioritize a deep understanding of the systemic nature of risks and their complexities against the local context. As R/MIS rely on descriptive models to analyze risks, these models must be designed with careful attention to the underlying uncertainties and assumptions that can shape the outcomes. Biases in the formulation of such models or interpretation of data will be reflected on decisions. That would also require experts on the content, besides technical ones. 

To mitigate the risk of misrepresentation, R/MIS can benefit from robust monitoring, evaluation, and learning processes, aiming at correcting the model whenever it is necessary. This iterative approach will help refine the system over time. Additionally, stakeholders must recognize that an R/MIS is a simplification of reality and that its outputs should be interpreted with caution, particularly when making critical decisions. Regular updates and recalibrations based on real-world feedback will improve the system's accuracy. 

To avoid the potential for harmful decisions based on incomplete or misleading information, it is recommended to implement a transparent process that incorporates contextual factors into the MIS. This includes actively engaging local communities, climate and disaster response experts, and urban planners. The system should also support accessible ways to report and visualize data, enabling users to easily reach the insights provided by the system. A user-friendly interface is key, frequently accessible from different devices and platforms. 

In order to identify and mitigate technology-related human rights risks within KfW-financed projects, we recommend to use the [KfW Human Rights Check for Financial Development Cooperation](https://digitalrights-check.bmz-digital.global/kfw/) during project preparation and implementation.
 
## Project Examples / Use Cases
------

- The Centre of Operations of Rio (COR) was designed to facilitate the response to disasters and major events [(Cosgrave et al. 2013)](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10087869/). The project included new facilities that could physically integrate operators from 30 different departments, such as emergency response, traffic and public service providers. Apart from that, a robust system to integrate data from various sources was developed to facilitate the operations management in the city. The system also counts with spatial data used to map vulnerabilities and orient operations during disasters and major events. The project results from an initiative from the City of Rio de Janeiro with private partners that provided the adequate technologies. IBM played a pivotal role as the provider of the technological backbone for the project. The project also counts with partnerships with digital companies that provide data for the system, such as Waze and Twitter. The project had an initial cost of more than 8.5 million USD for the construction of the centre, technology infrastructure, software development and initial training ([use 2024](https://use.metropolis.org/case-studies/rio-operations-center)). COR allows for real-time data analysis, enabling city officials to make informed decisions quickly, especially during emergencies like floods, landslides, and large public events. It enhances coordination across departments and the use of municipal resources. Traffic management tools also improved overall traffic in the city. One of the main aspects of the success of COR is the collaboration from different departments and stakeholders. The system is also flexible to adopt new technologies and uses, being updated constantly. The City of Rio de Janeiro is also elaborating a guide for making COR a benchmark for other cities to adopt similar solutions.
