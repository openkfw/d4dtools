# Communication and collaboration tools

## Short overview
------

### General Description

Education is increasingly promoting, using and including electronic and digital technologies. Digital collaboration and learning tools can leverage the advantages of unlimited access and easy availability of information ([Zhang 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3629296.3629305)) in any place and at any time. 

‘eLearning’ refers to the delivery of education and training through digital resources ([OHSC 2024](https://www.oxfordhomestudy.com/OHSC-Blog/what-is-elearning)), as opposed to in-person trainings. E-learning is an umbrella term for different ways of teaching and learning. The most common ones are synchronous learning in parallel with others and asynchronous or self-paced learning. Linking in-person to e-learning resources is known as blended learning, and could combine the benefits of both forms. E-learning also allows for the inclusion of web tools like YouTube videos or videogames ([Jaime et al. 2019](https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJTEL.2019.100481)) and establishing libraries other actors could contribute to, thereby further developing materials and case studies ([Catindig et al. 2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3377571.3377629)). Online games like UNDRR’s [Stop Disasters Game](https://www.stopdisastersgame.org/) are a more playful way to learn about the effects of climate risks and how to combat them. Flooding is one of the natural hazards included as a scenario in this particular game, that “teaches adults and children how to build safer villages and cities against disasters”. 

Virtual collaboration tools include email, videoconferencing, digital data sharing platforms and other tools facilitating working and collaborating with team members at distance ([Berente & Howlson 2019](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-20992-6_43)). Many of these are natural components of project work anyway. 

E-conferencing as a form of virtual communication can contribute to identifying and closing research gaps on natural hazards, for example by supporting the development of conceptual frameworks, implementing cross-sectoral guidelines and humanitarian standards (e.g. in the case of landslides, see [Dias et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-60196-6_50)).

Both, e-learning and virtual collaboration tools could be developed newly for any project, or existing materials can be applied in support of projects.

### Potential for Climate Change Adaptation

Building climate change literacy is vital for both, project managers and affected citizens, to understand the impacts of climate change and develop solutions to adapt to and mitigate climate change ([Ignacio et al. 2023](https://cgscholar.com/bookstore/works/development-of-an-elearning-module-integrating-systems-thinking-for-climate-change)). Digital learning as well as collaboration tools can both be important instruments for building and exchanging related knowledge.

### Potential for Disaster Risk Management

The complexity of disasters requires knowledge around the phases of disaster risk reduction in specific contexts and for different types of hazards. E-learning can be a vital instrument for building and disseminating such knowledge, including in international or cross-national contexts where in-person exchanges might be more cumbersome ([Koesoema et al. 2019](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/630/1/012019)). Teaching by means of scenarios or virtual exchanges can support preparedness of actors in DRM ([Jaime et al. 2019](https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJTEL.2019.100481)).  

Also, digital collaboration tools can both be important instruments for building and exchanging related knowledge.

## Application in different Climate Hazards
------

### Flooding

Addressing the lack of knowledge and preparedness towards flood hazards, especially among highly vulnerable groups, such as children, is crucial. E-learning tools are able to provide target-focused, comparatively low-cost and portable education. The content of such e-learning modules may include general flood knowledge, information on flood warning and flood response ([How et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00404)). Coastal flooding is also a scenario used in UNDRR’s [Stop Disaster Game](https://www.stopdisastersgame.org/), an open-source online game using abstract scenarios, while the Lagos2199 game uses the case of Nigeria’s capital city ([Keys & Keys 2022](https://ecologyandsociety.org/vol27/iss3/art40/)).

### Sea Level Rise

Coastal cities are at particular risk from water-induced disasters, and rising sea levels have immense impacts on livelihoods and urban layouts. Hence a number of virtual learning materials is focusing on coastal flooding and its present and future impact on cities. Materials include among others a course on [Green Infrastructure for Coastal Cities](https://www.learningfornature.org/en/courses/green-infrastructure/),  that follows a risk-based approach with adaptation options to address floods, landslides and mudflows. Other materials showcase and visualize community-level impacts of coastal flooding or sea level rise (e.g. the [NOAA Sea level Rise Viewer](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/slr.html) coming with learning materials) or focus on the consequences of coastal flooding and sea level rise, such as migration from and to cities, for instance in a course on Human Mobility in the Context of Climate Change. 

### Landslide

Modeling landslide risk is essential for risk mitigation and planning, hence assessing the risks of landslides as well as their potential human and economic losses are captured in various e-learning tools. These cover sectoral approaches such as the [Road Geohazard Risk Management E-learning](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/sustainablecities/road-geohazard-risk-management-new-tools-and-e-learning) available at the World Bank Open Learning Campus (OLC) or particular softwares and tools, e.g. for landslide susceptibility assessments in Project Manager Suite (LSAT PM) ([Torizin et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-2791-2022)), or  GIS-based landslide susceptibility modelling with machine learning ([Ali et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gsf.2020.09.004)). Interactive simulation tools showcasing landslide impacts can influence decision-making and thereby improve preparedness and reduce impacts ([Chaturvedi et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-18-1599-2018)). 

Furthermore, E-conferencing as a form of virtual communication can contribute to identifying and closing research gaps on landslide disaster risk reduction and management ([Dias et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-60196-6_50)).

### Water Scarcity / Drought

Collaborative learning networks provide peer-to-peer learning opportunities to increase drought resilience ([Elias et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-22-0017.1)). This can be facilitated by sharing lessons learned from past events and documenting drought impacts and responses during current disasters. 

### Strong Winds / Storms

Collaboration of researchers amongst each other and with communities is essential for resilience-building and preparedness in the face of hazards, such as hurricanes. Especially information on risk and vulnerability from communities must be incorporated effectively. Virtual methods are able to overcome geographic barriers, link researchers and practitioners and enable shared responsibilities for team goals. This can build trust and support innovative engagement and ultimately contribute to data collection and autonomous community responses ([Stablein et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102558)).

### Forest / Bush Fires

E-learning can be a vital instrument to raise awareness and learn on growing risks from forest and bush fires, including by knowledge exchange from areas where such risk has been high before. Target audiences are broad and include policy-makers, actors in climate action and risk reduction as well as students. For instance, a study found that video game technology could contribute to university education in disaster risk management related to wildfire response ([Jaime et al. 2019](https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJTEL.2019.100481)). There are also applications for citizens to foster individual action at home or work ([Country Fire Authority, n.d.](https://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/plan-prepare/your-local-area-info-and-advice/e-learning)), and improve urban planning, by adapting urban design for bushfire-resilient homes ([University of Melbourne, n.d.](https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/microcredentials/urban-design-for-bushfire-resilient-homes/)). 

### Extreme Temperatures

Extreme heat and urban heat islands are topics already taken up in various online learning and gaming formats, often applying design-based methodologies. Diverse formats and materials are geared towards different audiences, from raising citizen awareness (e.g. by games as presented by [Crisman et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1080/00958964.2023.2183173)) to informing urban planners (e.g. by means of webinars such as from [UrbanShift](https://www.shiftcities.org/post/how-cities-are-beating-urban-heat)), or  teaching on related assessments (e.g. on [Satellite Remote Sensing for Measuring Urban Heat Islands and Constructing Heat Vulnerability Indices](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/get-involved/training/english/arset-satellite-remote-sensing-measuring-urban-heat-islands-and) by NASA). In addition, there are repositories with multiple digital materials and e-learning courses (e.g. from [Global Heat Health Information Network](https://ghhin.org/elearning-courses/)). 

### Saltwater Penetration

While salt water intrusion/penetration is a growing concern, including for urban areas, it has not yet been dealt with as much as with other hazards in communication and collaboration tools and e-learning. Available materials are often online publications (e.g. [IFRC/COCHAP 2024](https://preparecenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/4-Saltwater-Intrusion-COCHAP-fact-sheets.pdf)) or online repositories (such as from [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/saltwater-intrusion#overview) or [PSU](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth103/node/901)), not all with an exclusive focus on cities. Nevertheless, online tools and materials can be vital to inform about the current status and future scenarios impacting on water resources. 

## Application in DRM / CCA Measures
------

### Nature-based Solutions

E-learning tools and courses can educate how to implement NbS projects. They are able to provide a self-paced and accessible space for education and exchange on planning, design and implementation of NbS strategies. For example, the e-learning course of NCAI, GIZ and IUCN on ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) ([https://ncai.iisd.org/eba-course/](https://ncai.iisd.org/eba-course/)) introduces each step of the EbA Mainstreaming Cycle and informs participants where and how biodiversity and ecosystem co-benefits may be integrated in the project phases ([IISD 2023](https://www.iisd.org/system/files/2023-06/biodiversity-co-benefits-nature-based-solutions.pdf)). Overall, there is a couple of e-learning courses available, including for practitioners, that have content on application of NbS for DRM and CCA including in urban areas, such as the [Certificate Course on Nature-based Solutions for Disaster and Climate Resilience](https://pedrr.org/mooc/) by UNEP or a course on [Green Infrastructure for Coastal Cities](https://www.learningfornature.org/en/courses/green-infrastructure/),  and the number of materials keeps growing.

### Integrated Coastal Zone Protection

Virtual environments such as e-learning tools or collaborative networks can support interconnection and education of needs, insights, data, evaluations and forecasts. They can further facilitate communication including the end users, for example local communities. Collaboration is vital in understanding hazards, improving management and mitigating impacts ([Nichols et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00404)). 

### Stormwater Management

As key actors in urban development, spatial planners have a great influence on the hydrological cycle and therefore stormwater management of a city. Thus, their understanding and awareness of the topic are crucial for urban resilience and adaptation. E-learning tools and interactive programmes can provide knowledge to raise risk awareness and contribute to creating scenarios and mitigation measures supporting the evaluation of hydrological impacts of approaches ([Pasche et al. 2007](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=ce1d33f11a76cc23adb7908f38cd027e3416bb37)). 

In the context of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), e-learning platforms have proven to be effective tools for improving the understanding and application of WASH systems and building capacities. Modules addressing topics such as adaptation, planning, budgeting, monitoring and water resource management can promote sustainable and universal WASH service delivery ([Leal et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.2166/h2oj.2022.066)). 

### Waste Management

E-learning platforms with the respective modules can inform on waste treatment, disposal and recycling. Thereby, crucial information and education are exchanged overcoming geographical and communication barriers. By including information on technologies and equipment practitioners can be provided with new information for further training ([O’Callaghan et al. 2011](http://archive.sciendo.com/STU/stu.2011.19.issue-1/v10228-011-0022-z/v10228-011-0022-z.pdf)). 

## Relevance within the Project Cycle
------

Digital communication and collaboration tools can be very helpful throughout all phases of the project cycle. E-learning can be very powerful particularly during preparation and implementation.  

**Project Preparation:**

In the preparation phase collaboration tools can be used to agree on project goals across involved sectors and to agree on roles and responsibilities. Virtual site visits via web conferencing or other collaboration tools can inform project planning. Virtual tools can facilitate stakeholder engagement, and project preparation can be supported by building needed capacities of involved actors via digital learning tools. 

**Project Implementation:**

Skills for project implementation can be gained or deepened via e-learning, drawing on the wealth of available materials. Furthermore, targeted materials might be developed for the project as needed to secure capacitation of involved staff and other stakeholders. Virtual communication and collaboration can facilitate interaction between involved sectors and with experts outside of the project location.  

**Verification and Project Progress:** 

Virtual communication and collaboration can facilitate monitoring, enhance project effectiveness and contribute to accountability. E-learning can support effectiveness. 

**Final Project Review:**

Virtual communication can be used for review processes, reducing needs for travel. 

**Ex-Post Evaluation:**  

Virtual communication with local actors can support ex-post evaluations. Learnings from the exact project can be included in new e-learning materials to inform future projects or secure continued success of the implemented one. 

## Technology Requirements
------

Preconditions for implementing e-learning tools and collaborative networks, include technological and management components ([Nichols et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00404)): 

- ***Access to technology and internet:*** E-learning courses and tools, as well as virtual collaborations require a connection and device to access relevant content. 
- ***Collaboration leaders:*** Individuals initiate interactions and manage exchanges among participants. Thus, dialogues and collaboration can take place regardless of location and organization. 

## Legal Aspects
------

**Collaboration tools** must have adequate **security to protect the data**. Data leaks and security breaches threaten the viability of using the tool. Operators of collaboration tools must ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services. 

Video transmissions should be made with end-to-end encryption. To keep unwanted participants out, access restrictions (such as password entry or consent of the moderator when guests participate) must be set up (see [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.2.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/)) 

The chosen **license model of eLearning tools** must ensure sufficient access to the eLearning tool (ideally open-source). The license must also ensure that students may reasonably use the learning materials for private study. The PEA has to warrant that constraints of the respective license agreement are complied with - for example, that inadmissable copying of material is prevented ([RMMV Guidebook Section 2.2.2.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/)). 

The personal data of the students must only be collected and processed to the extent necessary for the training purpose. The eLearning tool must have adequate **security to protect the collected personal data** of the students, such as their names and addresses. Flawed or inadequate data security puts the rights of participants at risk, who should enjoy robust data protection allowing them to freelyl use the eLearning tool without fear of negative personal consequences [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/)

## Summary Assessment
------

### Overall Effectiveness

E-learning tools and virtual collaborations hold the potential to connect people independently from their location, exchange information, knowledge and lessons learnt and raise awareness and preparedness towards hazards. Being target-focused, comparatively low-cost and portable, e-learning is an accessible form of education with successful results in increasing knowledge and preparedness ([How et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00404)). 

### Overall Efficiency

Virtual environments, such as E-learning, are able to reduce overall costs of education by saving space and time for students and teachers. It further shows efficiency in overcoming geographic obstacles, increasing self-learning flexibility and improving up-to-date content and competitiveness. However, in-person relations may suffer and technological requirements, such as devices and connections, are necessary ([QUIS 2005](http://www2.tisip.no/quis/public_files/wp7-cost-effectiveness-efficiency.pdf)).

### Key Challenges and Limitations

The limitations of e-learning and virtual collaboration can be described by the following ([Stablein et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102558)):

- Virtual environments can increase the psychological distance of disasters or hazards and place them outside a person’s reality. This has implications for the perception and approach to disasters. 
- E-learning and virtual collaborations miss out on opportunities for in-person collaboration. 
- Data protection, privacy and other data extraction risks must be considered.

Besides, the implementation of e-learning requires stable and regular access to needed devices and internet connection, particularly for courses that are developed as synchronous learning. In addition, e-learning requires a certain level of digital skills and literacy. Therefore, analogue and face-to-face learning alternatives are still essential to reduce inequalities.  As there is already a very large and constantly growing range of products, so one should first find out what is already on the market before developing own materials.  

For more comprehensive information on human rights-related challenges and limitations, see the [Principles for Digital Development](https://digitalprinciples.org/), the [Global Digital Compact](https://www.un.org/global-digital-compact/en), as well as [Mejias and Couldry (2024)](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo216184200.html). 

### Recommendations to optimize the Use of the Digital Tool

The following recommendations address the challenges above ([How et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00404); [Stablein et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2022.102558)): 

- By combining e-learning tools with in-person education and hardware learning kits a comprehensive provision of knowledge and education is possible. 
- Incorporating opportunities for building relationships in virtual collaborations can address psychological distances created by online environments. 

Further Recommendations include ([Nichols et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00404)): 

- Learning collaboratives should include governmental, industrial, academic and other participants to facilitate a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach to community resilience 
- Including the exchange of information, approaches, challenges and successes can improve virtual education, such as via e-learning tools 

When developing your own materials or communication formats, these should be checked for long-term usability, availability on relevant platforms and compatibility with other existing tools and formats. 

In order to identify and mitigate technology-related human rights risks within KfW-financed projects, we recommend to use the [KfW Human Rights Check for Financial Development Cooperation](https://digitalrights-check.bmz-digital.global/kfw/) during project preparation and implementation. 

## Project Examples / Use Cases
------

- Proactive adaptive measures are fundamental to drought resilience. Following a grave drought over the Colorado Plateau 2018, climate service organizations realized the potential of a network sharing successful drought responses and created the *Southwest Drought Learning Network* (DLN) together with resource managers and government representatives ([Elias et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-22-0017.1); [Bernadt 2023](https://dln.swclimatehub.info/about)). The network aims to provide peer-to-peer learning and exchange opportunities. The network consists of at least 125 people representing around 40 organizations organised in five teams. They focus on building drought resilience by sharing case studies, hosting drought briefings, identifying information for management decisions, innovating monitoring technologies and incorporating indigenous communities. The resulting collaboration and partnerships enable leveraging the resources and strengths of individuals. The network ultimately works towards fostering drought resilience by transferring successful lessons learned between communities and improving responses to future droughts.

- *CoastLearn* is an e-learning programme for Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) promoting education on ICZM principles, benefits, options and processes and facilitating international cooperation ([Ferreira et al. 2011](https://ypcc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/III-3-2-3.pdf)). It aims to transfer experiences and lessons learnt as well as to develop and test new technologies. The programme targets professionals in the public sector, planning institutes, NGOs and university-level students. While mainly created for European countries in transition, CoastLearn has proven to be of value for non-target countries worldwide too. It is available in multiple languages and consists of eight modules: Principles of ICZM, Policy Analysis, GIS, Planning, Environmental Risk Assessment, Sustainable Tourism, Public participation, Biodiversity. The programme is set to be further developed to improve its contribution to networks between practitioners and trainers.
