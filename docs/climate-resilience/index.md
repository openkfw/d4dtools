# Climate Resilience

In this section, you will find a thematic introduction to the use of digital tools for urban resilience. While they were developed primarily for KfW staff, project executing agencies, and project consultants they are also informative for a general audience.

They provide background information on when and why a specific tool is relevant for climate change adaptation and disaster risk management. The introduction is accompanied by overall eight fact sheets on selected tools. Each covers definitions, application areas, requirements, summaries on effectiveness, efficiency, challenges/limitations and recommendations, implementation examples and information on linkages to other tool types. Each text and fact sheet is accompanied by links to research and further resources on the topic.


## Introduction

- [The need for urban climate resilience](Introduction/intro.md)
- [Digital solutions to enhance urban climate resilience](Introduction/solutions-resilience.md)
- [Opportunities of urban digital solutions to strengthen urban climate resilience](Introduction/opportunities.md)
- [Challenges and limitations of urban digital solutions](Introduction/challenges.md)

## A quick overview of the featured digital tools

- [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](fact-sheets-cres/ai.md) refers to cutting edge algorithms or methods that mimic the decision-making process of humans, learning and becoming more accurate with time. In urban settings they lie at the center of analytics and prediction efforts. 
- [Data sources](fact-sheets-cres/data-sources.md) bring together the terms of Big and Open data, describing vast amounts of data grouped in datasets and data that is publicly accessible. Given the massive amount of information cities produce, such sources are key to deal with complexity and enhance accountability. 
- [Digital Twins](fact-sheets-cres/digital-twins.md) are virtual replicas of an object or system, designed to provide an accurate representation of its dynamics. Such tools are widely used to virtually replicate cities to test and investigate scenarios and prepare for their consequences. 
- [Communication and collaboration tools](fact-sheets-cres/communication.md) enable unlimited access to information, learning and collaboration to a wide audience. In urban settings they enable capacity development, emergency messaging and collective actions, for instance.
- [Earth observation tools](fact-sheets-cres/eot.md) refer to GIS systems, software working with geospatial databases, and remote sensing (RS) methods, collecting data about the physical characteristics of the earth. Mostly based on satellite imagery, this tool supports mapping and the monitoring of diverse systems in cities.
- [Mobile tools](fact-sheets-cres/mobile-tools.md) are used for collecting information from the field via mobile devices such as smart-phones, tablets or GPS-trackers. In reacting to urban crises, they allow for crowdsourcing of real-time data collection even in remote places. 
- [(Remote) Management Information Systems](fact-sheets-cres/rmis-cres.md) are integrated platforms that support decision-making using data from varied sources. MIS is useful for tracking the progress of complex projects and orient urban operations, particularly in the context of crisis. 
- [Internet of Things (IoT)](fact-sheets-cres/iot.md) generally describes an interconnected network of sensors connected to the internet that provide information to a centralized system. In cities, such sensors can be used to monitor diverse areas, including measuring the temperature, air quality or traffic congestion levels. 

The aim of the fact sheets is to provide a comprehensive overview of available tools and to assess their implementation in specific climate hazards and related measures.

While the technologies are presented separately, they might be implemented as a set of measures. Therefore, the chapter concludes on a [summary on integration of different Tool Types](integration.md).
