# Climate Resilience

:::info[Work in progress]

    This section is still being finalized. Soon you will will be able to read more about the use of digital tools for urban resilience. 
    
:::

In this section, you will find a thematic introduction to the use of digital tools for urban resilience. The description of the field is accompanied by fact sheets on each selected technology. Each covers definitions, aplication areas, implementation examples, integration with other technologies, effectiveness, efficiency, challenges/limitations and recommendations. Across each introductory text and factsheet, you will find links to research and further resources on the topic.

## Introduction

- [Introduction to urban resilience](Introduction/intro.md)
- [Digital solutions for building urban resilience](Introduction/solutions-resilience.md)
- [Opprtunities of urban digital solutions to strengthen climate resilience](Introduction/opportunities.md)
- [Challenges and limitations of urban digital solutions](Introduction/challenges.md)

## Factsheets

The identified key digital technologies are categorized into eight clusters presented afterwards. Each cluster is detailed through a table that provides an overview of: 

- the concept with a general description of the technology
- the potential for climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk management (DRM)
- possibilities of application in DRM or CCA measures or to address different climate hazards
- examples of real-world implementations
- technology requirements
- possible integration with other technologies
- general assessment regarding the solution's effectiveness and efficiency
- key challenges, limitations and recommendations to optimize the use of the technology

The aim of these tables is to provide a comprehensive overview of available technologies and to assess their implementation in specific climate hazards and related measures.

While the technologies are presented separately, they might be implemented as a set of measures.

The factsheets are the following:

- [Artificial Intelligence (AI)](fact-sheets-cres/ai.md)
- [Data sources](fact-sheets-cres/data-sources.md)
- [Digital Twins](fact-sheets-cres/digital-twins.md)
- [Communication and collaboration tools](fact-sheets-cres/communication.md)
- [Earth observation tools](fact-sheets-cres/eot.md)
- [Mobile tools](fact-sheets-cres/mobile-tools.md)
- [(Remote) Management Information Systems](fact-sheets-cres/rmis-cres.md)
- [Internet of Things (IoT)](fact-sheets-cres/iot.md)
