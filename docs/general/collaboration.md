# Collaboration tools

## Definition

Collaboration tools (or groupware) are software applications designed
to optimize the interactions or "group processes" for people working
on a common task. Their objectives are to increase teamwork
efficiency, allow multitasking, reduce miscom- munication, increase
search capabilities, and reduce paperwork, among others.

### Levels of Collaboration

Collaboration tools can support one or a combination of the fol-
lowing categories:

- **Communication** and **interaction** (including phone and video calls), instant group or one-on-one messaging and conferencing, voting, brainstorming and digital whiteboarding:

- **File sharing / document management**

- **Collaboration** for complex interdependent work [see Fact Sheet Building Information Modeling (BIM)](bim.md)

## Tool Types and Features

- **Videoconferencing software** communicate through video and audio
  and share screens, documents, whiteboards or other collaboration
  tools

- **Electronic calendars** (or time management software) schedule events and automatically notify and remind group members

- **Project management systems** schedule, track, and chart the steps
  in a project

- **Online proofing systems** share, review, approve, and reject web proofs, artwork, photos, or videos between designers, cus- tomers,
  and clients either in real-time, where multiple users engage in live,
  simultaneous and reversible editing, or in ver- sion control mode in
  which users make parallel edits, preserv- ing every saved edit by
  every user as multiple files (that are variants of the original file)

- **Workflow systems** support task /document management within a knowledge-based business process

- **Knowledge management systems** collect, organize, man- age, and
  share various forms of information

- **Blockchain Technology**: Project Monitoring and Managment including tracking of financial flows by using
  [TruBudget](https://trubudget.net/)

- **Client portals** interact and share information with clients in a
  private online environment

Depending on project needs, some of these collaborative plat- forms
can be upgraded with plugins or mobile offline features and therefore
become hybrids offering the basic functionalities of an R/MIS, for
example [see Fact Sheet on (Remote) Management (R/MIS)](rmis.md).

## Acquisition Options

KfW is already equipped with several collaboration tools to sup- port
decision-making on the best fitting one(s) for project needs. For
specific cases in which tools need to be procured, there are three
main options to consider:

- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a subscription-based licensing model
  in which access to the collaboration tool is provided via the
  internet, as it is located on the service provider's servers. Users
  typically access the tool through a web browser (of any
  internet-connected device) using a username and password instead of
  installing the software. Advantages are access from anywhere to
  sophisticated apps without deployment, interoperability
  development and maintenance costs (per device), and pay-per-usage.

- Self-hosting is a more hands-on approach that keeps the application
  on one's own (virtual) private server (VPS). A large majority of
  SaaS web applications can't be self-hosted, however, so innovative
  open-source alternatives have been developed. Advantages are data
  ownership and security with end- to-end encryption, centralization
  of all collaboration tools on one server, and competitive features.
  An open-source collaboration software is available to everyone, in
  some cases for free; its code can be changed and distributed to
  anyone, meaning it has limited warranty. The advantage lies in its
  limitless customization possibilities and low-cost distribution
  and responsive support thanks to a committed community.

- Proprietary software cannot be owned since its code is kept
  closed-source by providers and distribution or modification is
  prohibited. However, its usage can be rented and is limited by an
  agreement. The advantage lies in the reliability and compatibility
  of its features, but the user can be dependent on the provider's
  willingness to upgrade, develop, and maintain the software.
  Proprietary software is a good fit for projects in need of instant
  deployment of collaboration tools and typical productivity needs.

## Interoperability

Certain collaboration tools do not operate together (for example,
video conferencing systems and file sharing apps), meaning that users
are forced to migrate to unknown collaboration tools with the same
functionality of the ones they are already using. They can make up for
it via integration (indirect connection---via a "middleware" third
party--- so that data from one system can be accessed by the other
one). It means that actions in certain applications can trigger
functionalities in others.

Device experience interoperability fares better due to a hard-
ware-dominated market, which translates into vendors providing for
multidevice connections (adding sometimes multi-feature possibilities)
to collaboration tools.

The surge in collaboration tools usage generated by conditions during
the COVID-19 pandemic may be the nudge ending the siloed multiplatform
reality. Lacking interoperability decreases collaboration efficiency
and increases end-user frustration and shadow IT (the use of
hardware/software unapproved by the employer's IT unit: for example,
using Skype chat when only MS Teams is cleared or bringing one's
private USB-drive to share files), which, in turn, may bring security
issues (such as outdated technology, tools protection, etc.)

## Legal Aspects

**Data Security**:

- Collaboration tools must have adequate **security to protect the
  data.** Data leaks and security breaches threaten the via- bility of
  using the tool.

- Operators of collaboration tools must ensure confidentiality,
  integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and
  services.

Video transmissions should be made with end-to-end encryption. To keep
unwanted participants out, access restrictions (such as password entry
or consent of the moderator when guests participate) must be set up (see
[RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.2.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/))

**Data protection**:

- Only personal data strictly relevant for the collaboration should be
  collected and processed in the tool.

- Controllers of personal data must also apply appropriate technical
  and organizational measures to satisfy data protection laws.
  Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and
  implemented to meet security principles and to provide adequate
  safeguards to protect personal data (see [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/))

- In most cases, the **ownership of the data** (including images,
  audio, video files of virtual meeting participants) remains with the
  users and is not shared with the provider of the collaboration
  software/platform. Attention should be paid to the issue of whether
  the service contract for using the collaboration tool confirms the
  entity's ownership of their data located on the vendor's servers, as
  well as the right to retrieve and delete the data at the end of the
  project. The service contract for using the tool should further rule
  out any disclosure of the stored information to third parties
  without prior consent.

- If KfW (or persons acting on behalf of it) are (also) processing
  personal data, the privacy check in [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/) must be followed.

## Project Examples / Use Cases

- In several countries, for example in Tunisia, [KfW's Open-Source software TruBudget](https://trubudget.net/) is used as the main monitoring
  and management tool for the governments of receiving countries.
  Blockchain technology is used to track the workflow of projects
  and therefore minimize the risk of corruption.

- KfW has established special RMMV rooms in its offices that offer
  additional possibilities for collaboration, that can be used for
  remote appraisals and progress reviews, virtual site inspections,
  etc. [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.4.1.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/)
