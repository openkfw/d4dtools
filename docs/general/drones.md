# Drones / UAV (Airborne Observation)

Drones can be helpful in providing aerial imagery for monitoring
agriculture, wildlife, the environment, and infrastructure (e.g.,
bridges, buildings, and roads).

## Definition

A drone (also: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; UAV) is an aircraft with- out
a human pilot aboard. Drones can be equipped with sensors and cameras
to analyze and monitor specific project locations (including,
infrared, night vision, 3D-cameras, and video recording).

## How to Employ Drones

### Step 1: Is It Allowed?

The operation of drones is subject to national laws and regulations (see [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/) for
further details).

### Step 2: What Information Do I Need?

Drones are collecting data to make accurate, two-dimensional maps,
elevation models, and 3D models of terrain. Mapping is the most common
and most popular drone application to date:

- Capturing aerial imagery and making base maps of small areas (less than 15 square kilometres)

- Collecting optical imagery where cloud cover precludes the use of
  satellites and airplanes

- Operating in dense and fast-changing environments, such as urban
  areas and refugee camps

- Creating accurate elevation models needed for flood, avalanche,
  and debris flow modelling and rubble volume calculations

- Making 3D renderings of buildings and geographic features

### Step 3: What to Consider When Acquiring Them

Does a project stakeholder already use drones? Can they be employed
for the project?

If not, is a purchase of equipment (drones, cameras, sensors) needed
or are full-service providers available? Operating drones and
processing aquired data requires trained personnel see Drone
Procurement Guide [Links to Further Sources](#links-to-further-sources).

How do I obtain the permit from the local authorities?

If the target area is populated, how do I prepare the local population
for the deployment of drones?

Are additional preparation steps needed, for example flight plans,
detailed piloting instructions, and equipment opera- tions?

How will the collected data be extracted and processed, for example
feature mapping, rendering of 2D images, or 3D models?

Are specialists/experts needed to analyze the data?

## Types of Drones

A wide variety of drones are already being used for mapping and
monitoring purposes:

- **Fixed-wing drones** (like a plane) are used for long distance operations (larger mapping projects or surveillance) and typically
  stay in the air for several hours. Drawback: they require open space
  for landing and take-off.

- **Multi-rotor drones** (like a helicopter) are used for aerial photography or aerial video surveillance in short distances. Drawback:
  at present, most of the multi-rotor drones are capable of only 20 to
  30 minutes of flying time (often with a minimal payload like a
  camera).

- **Single-rotor drones** (like a helicopter) are more efficient than multi-rotor versions. They have higher flying times and can even be
  powered by gas engines. They can be used for aerial laser scanning
  (LiDAR). Drawback: higher costs, complexity, and danger.

- **Hybrid drones** combine advantages of fixed-wing and multi-rotor drones but are highly complex to operate.

- **Kite drones** are used for aerial photography in low-resource
  environments.

Most drones are flown by human pilots stationed on the ground and
within sight of the drone (up to 1 km in clear skies).

## Types of Sensors

Optical instruments, or sensors, can be mounted on drones for
monitoring and surveying purposes:

- **Cameras** are used for aerial photography and video recordings.
  Photos captured with drones can be used for generating digital
  elevation models of small areas (approximately 5 ha).

- **LiDAR** (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors, which measure the reflection time of a pulsed laser beam, have a variety of uses,
  for example to generate accurate digital elevation models of bigger
  areas or in agriculture and forestry to analyze plant structures by
  height, density, or heterogeneity.

- **Electro-Optical Systems** (EOS) operate in visible and infra-red spectral ranges and may be used for thermal imaging, for example
  building inspection or night vision. EOS equipped with multi- or hyper-spectral cameras provide additional data on
  features, for example the health of crops.

## Risks and Alternatives

- **Danger of misuse** of drones for criminal and terrorist pur-
  poses, such as spying, smuggling, and (terrorist) attacks on people,
  vehicles, or buildings (combat drones).

- **Airplanes and helicopters** can also be used for airborne observations. They can capture very high-resolution imagery and highly
  accurate digital elevation models of large areas. Drawback: only a few
  providers are available, authorization is difficult, and costs are
  high.

- **Earth observation (EO, satellites)** is another source for aerial
  imagery and features mapping [Factsheet Earth Observation via Satellites](satellites.md).
  Compared to airborne observation, EO imagery can cover very large
  areas and provide retrospective analysis. Content is available from
  open and commercial sources and does not require additional
  authorization. Costs are dependent on the spatial and temporal
  resolution.

## Legal Aspects

**National Laws** are affecting the operation of drones and the
enforcement of these laws vary by country. Restriction arise from
national drone regulations, emissions regulations, and drone
restrictions of certain areas, such as critical infrastructure or at
certain times, for example during conflict. The United Nations
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) strives to provide a
fundamental international regulatory framework through Standards and
Recommended Practices ([see Links to Further Sources](#links-to-further-sources).

**Human rights:** In countries with human rights issues or in con-
flict settings, drone images can be used against the population or
vulnerable parts thereof, such as minorities. Especially in areas
where drones are not known or where combat drones have been operating,
drones may create fear among the population and, hence, operators are
required to inform the population before an operation starts [RMMV
Guidebook Section 2.3.3.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/).

**Data protection:** Drones equipped with cameras have the poten- tial
to violate privacy if individual persons are identifiable in the video
recordings. Avoid the inadvertent collection of personal data by
avoiding filming individuals in ways that could lead to their
identification. Only strictly relevant personal data should be
collected and processed. If data minimization is not possible, data
has to be anonymized (e.g., by blurring or pixilation ([RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/))

If KfW (or persons acting on behalf of it) are (also) processing
personal data, the privacy check in[RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/) must be followed.

**Liability:** If persons are injured or property is damaged during a
drone flight, the owner and/or the operator of the drone may be liable
regardless of whether he or she is at fault in the specific case
(i.e., intent or negligence). For this reason, many countries require
third-party insurance even if you are operating a lighter drone (e.g.,
Article 14 (2) (d) of EU Regulation 2019/947). Local law requirements
for insurance of drone operators should be checked.
