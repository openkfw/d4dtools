# Crowdsourcing Tools

 Crowdsourcing can be used to quickly collect up-to-date information
 from many individuals (often anonymously) at relatively low cost,
 especially from (potential) target groups and Project Affected People
 (PAP).

## Definition

 Crowdsourcing is a process used to collect ideas, observations,
 opinions, votes, or feedback through a participatory approach from
 large groups of people who are not known to the project partners, that
 is, the crowd, assisted by technical tools. The crowd participates
 voluntarily in the collection of data via the internet or mobile phone
 (SMS, MMS, or an App), usually without prior training in data
 collection. In so-called "bounded" crowd-sourcing, large but
 identified groups of people (e.g., staff members of a large
 organization) can be equipped and trained to use specific data
 collection tools (e.g., cameras, videos, etc.).

## What is the Purpose of Crowdsourcing?

 Crowdsourcing allows for the establishment of instant feedback loops
 with target groups and the engagement of beneficiary communities into
 problem-solving in projects. Crowdsourcing, therefore, enables the
 integration of local creative ideas and innovation into project design
 and implementation.

## How to Set Up Crowdsourcing
###  Step 1: Check the Principles!

 Before designing/selecting any crowdsourcing tool, the nine
 [Principles for Digital Development](https://digitalprinciples.org/) as
 well as the [Core Principles of Constituent Feedback](https://feedbacklabs.org/about-us/guiding-principles/)
 should be considered.

### Step 2: What are Our Objectives?

 Potential crowdsourcing objectives include:

#### Tailoring project design to local needs

 Crowdsourcing can be leveraged to engage communities living in a project area in the identification of problems as well as solutions (e.g., brainstorming with target groups). This can support
 situation and needs assessments and programming efforts while creating
 regular feedback loop mechanisms and trust between target groups and
 the Project Executing Agency.

#### Project monitoring and evaluation

 Project teams can periodically ask target groups to participate in
 surveys to collect regular monitoring data or conduct specific
 progress assessments (e.g., target group observations, evaluations,
 or satisfaction levels). In combination with effective [(Remote)
 Management Information Systems (R/MIS)](rmis.md), such solutions have the potential to make regular monitoring tasks and data
 collection for specific project indicators that are directly related
 to the target groups more effective.

#### Accountability and complaint mechanisms

 Beneficiaries are enabled to monitor the progress of infrastructure
 or other development projects by reporting problems. Similar
 reporting mechanisms can be used for incidents during elections and
 opinion polls or to gather information about the quality of public
 services.

#### Crowdsourcing simple tasks

 Simple or automatically verifiable tasks (e.g., market research for
 value-chains or microfinance assessments, local language translation, user reviews, open-source programming, etc.) can be
 crowdsourced and are often paid via mobile-phone-based micropayments.

### Step 3: What Types of Information and Tools Do I need?
 Crowdsourcing can deliver information on any topic as long as the
 relevant information is directly accessible to the participating
 individuals. This information is mostly provided as text, numbers, or
 Interacive Voice Response (IVR), but can
 sometimes contain photos, video imagery, or geo-tagged data, if
 offered by the chosen crowdsourcing software or platform. For market
 data observation or polling (opinions, votes, ideas), specific tools
 are available ([Links to Further Sources](#links-to-further-sources)).

### Step 4: How to Make Collaborating with the Crowd Possible?

 The effective application of crowdsourcing requires indepth local
 knowledge and clearly identified information needs to engage and
 empower the relevant crowd. As a minimum requirement, the crowd needs
 to have access to the required information and needs to be able to
 submit information as simply as possible. Crowds can be reached through open calls for participation via
radio, TV, or online or direct engagement in bounded crowdsourcing. Further considerations when engaging crowds are:

**Motivation** 

-   Vision (clearly defined ideals and objectives, e.g., government accountability)

-   Material incentives (e.g., micro-payments through mobile tools for
    accomplished tasks)

**Skillsets**

-   Communication skills (e.g., local languages, digital literacy,
    \[functional\] literacy)

-   Technical and professional skills (e.g., type of profession)

**IT infrastructure**

-   Ownership of crowdsourcing devices (e.g., simple vs. smart phone
    users; ITU for country data (see [Links to Further Sources](#links-to-further-sources))

-   Access to relevant infrastructure (e.g., cost for and connectivity
    to the internet)

### Step 5: Selecting Crowdsourcing Tools

 The selection of a crowdsourcing tool depends on both the information need and the characteristics of the crowd. For example, women sometimes do not possess their own phone, but share it. In general,
 user interfaces need to be as simple and engaging as possible to
 motivate participation.

-   **Mobile-based systems:** Open-source, mobile-based systems provide
    customizable crowdsourcing solutions for any information need that
    allows for data collection via SMS, social media, and direct upload
    of data by the crowd. **SMS**-based systems offer the crowd a
    two-way communication to select relevant information or optional
    answers similar to surveys. Similarly, **Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (SSD)** solutions allow the crowd to select options in pre-designed protocols and the project to receive brief survey data. **IVR** allows the crowd to interact with an automated host system to provide data input via voice recognition. This is increasingly part of open-source systems and an advantage in contexts of low literacy (Exampe: Decentralisation Programme Togo). Translating and sharing the tools in local tools can also be developed at high initial investment costs, see [(Remote) Management Information Systems (R/MIS) "Customized Software"](rmis.md).

-   **Social media:** Popular social media services can either work as a channel to engage crowds via mobile-based applications or directly used to collect data and feedback. The advantage of using social media directly is the high degree of familiarity and frequent visits to social media platforms, which facilitates crowd participation.

## Tools for Bounded crowdsourcing

-   **Online surveys:** Questionnaires can be drafted and made
     accessible via links to online survey providers for regular
     monitoring activities, for example. These can be customized, and
     links shared via social media, e-mail, or SMS. An existing
     communication channel with the relevant crowd is required.


## Legal Aspects

 **Local laws may** restrict collecting, processing, and exporting
 project-related data due to restrictions on the freedom of speech or
 restrictions on the use of crowdsourcing software.

 **Data protection** issues can arise in connection to the content
 (e.g. name, picture, opinion relating to specific person) and/or to
 the technical process of the data transfer (e.g. telephone num- ber).
 Only strictly relevant personal data should be collected and
 processed. If initial data minimization is not possible, data must be
 anonymized (by redaction or pixilation). In case KfW (or persons
 acting on its behalf) are (also) processing personal data, the privacy
 check in [Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/) must be followed.

 A Tool must have adequate **security to protect collected personal
 data**, such as mobile phone numbers and names. Data leaks and
 security breaches threaten the viability of using crowdsourcing
 platforms, as participants must trust them.

 Flawed or inadequate data security to provide robust data pro- tection
 puts the human rights of the participants at risk. This particularly
 applies in countries with limited freedom of opinion where
 crowdsourcing has the potential to put individuals at risk. In this
 situation, the privacy/anonymity of the participants should also be
 established in the Separate Agreement of the project [Section 3.1.4.2 Separate Agreement](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/).

 **Data security requirements** can also arise from local data
 protection regulations and/or the GDPR, which stipulate basic security
 requirements. Entities may be obliged under those rules to ensure the
 ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of
 processing systems and services.

 **Controllers of personal data** must also apply appropriate technical
 and organizational measures to satisfy data protection law. Business
 processes that handle personal data must be designed and implemented
 to meet security principles and to provide adequate safeguards to
 protect personal data, see [RMMV Guidebook  Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/).

 In case **social media** are being used, the future deletion of the
 content, including any user data, after the end of the project should
 be explicitly planned and ensured so that this data cannot be misused
 later. This applies in particular to personal data but is not limited
 to it.

## Project Examples/Use Cases

-  In the [Decentralisation Programme in Togo (PAD; PN:
 30205)](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/ipfz/Projektdatenbank/Programm-zur-UnterstÃ¼tzung-der-Dezentralisierung-30205.htm),
 the local population was involved using SMS/website for information
 sharing, participative community planning, and citizen feedback.
