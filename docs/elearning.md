# eLearning Tools

## Definition

  eLearning tools are primarily web-based software for the PEA,
  implementation-consultant, or eLearning providers to deliver training
  and content across a variety of electronic devices, including desktop
  and laptop computers, tablets, and smart- phones. eLearning can be
  conducted either in individual training sessions or in refresher
  courses as an instrument of continuous learning. It is especially
  advantageous in scenarios where beneficiaries or partners:
 
- are in different locations 
- face mobility challenges
- request short training sessions 
- have reliable connectivity
- want to learn at their own pace

### Types of eLearning Approaches

  Usually, remote eLearning interventions incorporate both of the
  following types of eLearning (blended learning):
 
  **Face-to-face workshops:** eLearning tools are used to facilitate in-person and live capacity building sessions.
 
  **Virtual learning:** eLearning tools enable users to study individually and/or participate in communities of practice.

## Setting up an eLearning tool
### Step 1: Integrate eLearning into Remote Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Systems

  A clear definition of the learning objective needs to be elabo- rated
  to integrate eLearning into M&E systems, including relevant indicators
  on every impact level. This will allow for evaluation of the eLearning
  intervention in surveys with learners.

### Step 2: Assess Needs and Feasibility

  Before eLearning tools are applied, the need for training and suitable
  content must be determined in dialogue with the learners and the PEA.
  Further, the feasibility of eLearning interventions based on the
  targeted learners' ecosystem must be assessed, including:
 
  Availability of IT devices
 
  Access to and costs for sufficient internet connection Reliable
  electricity provision
 
  Digital divide in access to IT resources based on local inequalities
 
  Familiarity of learners with eLearning and digital literacy Experience
  with learning in groups and social dynamics Language requirements,
  literacy
 
  Availability of learners during specific times of the day

### Step 3: What Kind of eLearning Tool Should I Choose? 

*The choice of an adequate tool is based on both the char- acteristics of the learners identified and the preferred eLearning approach.*

  **Potential tools used in eLearning are:**
 
  **[Collaboration tools](collaboration.md)** for conferencing can be used to
  organize live and in-person online trainings. Commercial providers of
  such tools often also offer a related webinar product to handle large
  numbers of learners. The most commonly used communications tools, like
  Signal or WhatsApp for instant messaging, can be used to establish
  links between learners and create communities of practice.
  File-sharing tools may also contribute to sharing content with and
  between learners.

 **Learning Management Systems (LMS)**

  LMS are online software that can be customized to create courses for
  learners to study at their own pace and attend live courses. Among the
  most common functionalities are the creation of digital courses,
  file sharing for course content, discussion forums for communities of
  practice and learner teacher communication, test automation, and
  assignment grading. Most solutions include a mobile application.
  Several open-source options exist (e.g., Moodle, Opigno).

 **Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)**

  MOOCs are courses that are made available online to a large audience.
  Course material and lectures are usually provided at no additional
  costs and cover a range of topics. Costs may be incurred however for
  course certification. Popular MOOCs with a large course catalogue include [EdX](https://www.edx.org/),
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/performance-assessment),
[Futurelearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/ocean-science-in-action-addressing-marine-ecosystems-and-food-security-in-the-western-indian-ocean),
and so on. The German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Develop- ment
  also offers the free eLearning platform
  [Atingi](https://www.atingi.org/) for all kinds of trainings for end
  users in the Global South, including certified vocational trainings.
  Atingi can be used to create courses from scratch as well, and offers
  methodological support and evalua- tions for remote M&E purposes.
  MOOCs with a specific focus on RMMV-related content include [NASA
  ARSET](https://appliedsciences.nasa.gov/what-we-do/capacity-building/arset)
  (Satellites, Sensors), [Copernicus
  MOOC](https://www.copernicus.eu/en/opportunities/education/copernicus-mooc)
  (Satellites), and [SERVIR
  Global](https://www.servirglobal.net/Training/) (Satellite, GIS).
  Further RMMV learning content is available for free from reputable
  research institutions on Edx, Coursera, [MIT
  Open-](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=remote%20monitoring&t=Developmental%20Economics&t=Community%20Development&t=Global%20Poverty&t=International%20Development&t=Surveying)
  [CourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?q=remote%20monitoring&t=Developmental%20Economics&t=Community%20Development&t=Global%20Poverty&t=International%20Development&t=Surveying)
  (GIS), and [OPEN.ED@PSU](https://roam.libraries.psu.edu/) (GIS).

 **Mixed eLearning approaches**

  To create the necessary preconditions for successful learning in
  ecosystems with low availability of IT infrastructure, internet
  access, and insufficient learning environments, using a physical
  teaching facility as a learning hub for learners can be beneficial.
  Learners can then access the web-based eLearning tools described above
  in such facilities. Sustainable strategies for this type of mixed
  eLearning would be to connect local institutions and internationally
  operating schools to avoid additional local competition and ensure
  continued funding in sustainable busi- ness models to cover recurring
  costs as well as personnel costs.

## Legal Aspects

  The chosen **license model** of the eLearning tool must ensure
  sufficient access to the eLearning tool (ideally open-source). The
  license must also ensure that students may reasonably use the learning
  materials for private study. The PEA has to warrant that constraints
  of the respective license agreement are com- plied with---for example,
  that inadmissable copying of material is prevented ( [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.2.2.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/))
 
  **Data protection:** the personal data of the students must only be
  collected and processed to the extent necessary for the training
  purpose.
 
  The eLearning tool must have adequate **security to protect the collected personal data** of the students, such as their names and
  addresses. Flawed or inadequate data security puts the rights of
  participants at risk, who should enjoy robust data pro- tection
  allowing them to freelyl use the eLearning tool without fear of
  negative personal consequences [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/)
