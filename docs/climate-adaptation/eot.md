# Geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing

On this page we are going to talk about GIS and remote sensing tools that can be used for climate resilience.

**Text in progress**

## Legal Aspects

  **National legislation** is generally not applicable to imagery from
  space.
 
  **Human rights risks:** In countries with human rights issues or in
  conflict settings, satellite images could be used against the pop-
  ulation or vulnerable parts thereof, such as minorities, if they are
  used to identify individual households when combined with sur- vey
  data or other sources of information. This information could be used
  for discriminatory policies, (state) terror attacks, and so on.
  Careful attention to data protection and data security (below) is
  required in order not to risk harming individuals or groups (see [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.3](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/)).

  **Data protection:** Very high-resolution images (finer than 0.31 m)
  or combined with other identifiers, such as address information,
  tracking of individuals, and groups and their movements  ("patterns of life"), for example, through data mining can cause an
  invasion of personal privacy. Avoid this by choosing lower resolution
  images, blurring individuals visible in the images, and by avoiding
  triangulating the images with personal data. Only strictly relevant
  personal data should be collected and processed by the data
  controller. If initial data minimization is impossible, data must be
  anonymized (e.g., by blurring or pixilation) (see [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/)).

  If KfW (or persons acting on its behalf) is (also) processing personal data, the privacy check in [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/) must be followed.
 
  **Data security requirements** can also arise from data protec- tion
  regulations (local and/or GDPR), which stipulate basic secu- rity
  requirements for storing and processing satellite images.
 
  Entities may be required under those rules to ensure the ongoing
  confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of storing
  and processing systems and services (technical and organizational
  measures) [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.2](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/)
