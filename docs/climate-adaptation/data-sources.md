# Data sources for climate resilience

On this page we are going to talk about Data sources tools that can be used for climate resilience.

**Text in progress**

## Legal Aspects 
**Local legal requirements** that restrict collecting project-related data by the R/MIS-owner (data controller) with MDC tools should always be complied with. For instance, some countries may prohibit photographing certain types of infrastructure. 
Where necessary, the PEA should request permission from authorities before commencing the collection of data.

Wherever possible, **the collection of personal data** should be avoided. Personal data includes any information relating to an identified or identifiable 
natural person. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to an identifier or a combination of identifiers such as a name, address, phone number or 
location data of that natural person. For instance, the geo-tagged picture or video of a person or a private premise can be considered personal data if the person can be identified from the geo-tagged 
location. 

The project should look into technical solutions of avoiding the identification of individual persons, such as blurring their faces. Avoiding the collection 
of personal data can be further achieved, for example, by anonymizing the responses to questionnaires/surveys wherever possible or by the pseudonymization of data.

If the collection of personal data cannot be avoided, the project should make sure that the main principles of data protection are adhered to, that is, personal data must:

- be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the person
- only be used for legitimate purposes in relation to the project 
- be limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes of the project
- be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
- not be kept longer than is necessary for the purposes of the project
- be securely stored, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against 
accidental loss

In case KfW (or persons acting on its behalf) are (also) processing personal data, the privacy check 
in > [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/) must be followed. In case of copyright questions or issues  [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.4 (Rights of Use)](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/).
