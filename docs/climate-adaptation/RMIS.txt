# (Remote) Management Information Systems (R/MIS)

On this page we are going to talk about R/MIS tools that can be used for climate resilience.

**Text in progress**

## Legal Aspects

 **Data Security:** If a desktop software system is used, data secu-
 rity should be warranted by ensuring:

 that the data are protected against unauthorized or accidental
 destruction, accidental loss, technical defects, falsification, theft,
 unlawful use, unauthorized modification or duplication, and other
 forms of unauthorized access and use by technical means regular backup of data appropriate security of hardware

 If the software is provided as web-based service (SaaS), the provider should be contractually obliged to take appropriate organizational and technical precautions to prevent disruptions to the availability, integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of their IT  systems, components, and processes essential to the functioning of the  critical infrastructures they operate. The provider should implement  data backup concepts, ensuring the protection of data against loss due to system-related failures.

**Data protection:** Wherever possible, the collection of personal data by
 the R / MIS-owner (data controller) should be avoided. If this is
 impossible, the main principles of data protection must be adhered to,
 that is, personal data shall:

 - be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation
 to the person
- be used only for the legitimate purpose in relation to the project
- be limited to what is necessary in relation towthe purposes for the
 project
- be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date
- not be kept longer than is necessary for the purposes of the project
- be securely stored, including protection against unauthorized or
 unlawful processing and against accidental loss

 In case KfW (or persons acting on behalf of it) are (also) process-
 ing personal data, the privacy check in  [> RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/) must be followed.

 If R / MIS tools allow **tracking of employees**, legal restrictions
 on the use of such tools may arise from applicable local laws. Some
 privacy laws will give discretion to employers as to how far they can
 go with their employee monitoring programs. In other cases, employers
 will have to inform employees who are likely to be monitored or even
 require employees to consent.
