# Internet of Things (IoT)

On this page we are going to talk about IoT tools that can be used for climate resilience.

**Text in progress**

## Legal Aspects

  **Data protection:** Smart meters provide insights into the con-
  sumption patterns of private households and are thus sensitive in
  terms of data privacy. Data transmission is only permitted for the
  applications required for utility industry operations. The use of
  personal data for other purposes will, depending on the applicable
  law, require consent from consumers [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/)

 
  In addition, **data security requirements** also arise from national
  data protection regulations, which stipulate basic security
  requirements to protect the collected personal data, such as
  consumption, address, and names. Entities may be required under those
  rules to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability,
  and resilience of processing systems and services (technical and
  organizational measures). They need to ensure that the IT security
  measures are adequate to withstand attacks from hackers or cyber
  warfare directed at critical infra-structure (see [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.2](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/)).
