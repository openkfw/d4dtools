# Digital Twins

On this page we are going to talk about Digital Twins tools that can be used for climate resilience.

**Text in progress**

## Legal Aspects
Use of BIM must be reflected in the projectâ€™s construction and 
engineering **contracts**. Since the BIM tool is used by all engineers involved in the project, the respective responsibilities of 
the parties must be carefully defined. In bigger projects, contracts should define the role of a BIM manager. Further, since all engineers use BIM, effective intellectual property rights 
management is necessary [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.4](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook).
The BIM tool must have adequate **security to protect the collected data** and to ensure that it is kept **confidential**. Data 
leaks and security breaches threaten the viability of using BIM 
software. All participating entities are required to ensure the 
ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of 
processing systems and services. They need to ensure that their 
individual and collective IT security measures are adequate to 
whithstand cyber-crime attacks. (see  [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.2](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook)).

If KfW (or persons acting on behalf of it) are (also) processing personal data, the privacy check in [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook) must be followed.
