# Communication and collaboration tools

On this page we are going to talk about Communication and collaboration tools that can be used for climate resilience.

**Text in progress**

## Legal Aspects

  The chosen **license model** of the eLearning tool must ensure
  sufficient access to the eLearning tool (ideally open-source). The
  license must also ensure that students may reasonably use the learning
  materials for private study. The PEA has to warrant that constraints
  of the respective license agreement are com- plied with---for example,
  that inadmissable copying of material is prevented ( [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.2.2.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/))
 
  **Data protection:** the personal data of the students must only be
  collected and processed to the extent necessary for the training
  purpose.
 
  The eLearning tool must have adequate **security to protect the collected personal data** of the students, such as their names and
  addresses. Flawed or inadequate data security puts the rights of
  participants at risk, who should enjoy robust data pro- tection
  allowing them to freelyl use the eLearning tool without fear of
  negative personal consequences [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1.](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/)
