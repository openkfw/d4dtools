This Fact Sheet was developed for all practitioners in preparing and implementing Financial Cooperation (FC) projects and provides them with assistance and examples of how to manage, monitor, and verify FC projects remotely.
This Fact Sheet was carefully drafted by KfW, its advisers, and experts on the topics covered reflecting the extensive experience gained in KfW’s own FC projects.

It does not constitute any form of legal, technical, or other advice and therefore does not purport to replace such legal, technical, or other advice for a specific project or question by a user.
Before entering into any of the activities contemplated in this Fact Sheet, any Fact Sheet user should first seek advice for themselves as they deem necessary and should not solely rely upon the material and information given herein as a basis for making any business, legal, or other decision. Any use of the material or information provided in this Fact Sheet for specific projects is at the user’s own risk.
Due to the general nature of this Fact Sheet, conclusions drawn from it always need to be adjusted to the specific needs and design of the respective project context. KfW can therefore not be held liable for any use and any conclusions drawn from this Fact Sheet.
