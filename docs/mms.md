# Maintenance Management Systems (MMS)

## Definition

 MMS is an integrated software to manage a project's or operator's
 maintenance operations and optimize the utilization and availability
 of equipment, infrastructure and/or maintenance staff. It is used by
 permanent infrastructure projects (such as schools, clinics, roads,
 power plants, etc.), financing a considerable number of assets with
 inventory, including equipment such as vehicles, machinery, and spare
 parts. It can be categorized in two types: highly sector-specific and
 proprietary or standard and simple asset management systems. Setting
 up an MMS is an ownership incentive for the Project Executing Agency
 (PEA) or long-term operator to operate and maintain assets during and/or after
 the end of the project in a sustainable manner.

 MMS offers many advantages, such as safety improvement, uptime
 reliability, downtime, and paperwork reduction.

## How to select an MMS?

### Step 1: Check the Digital Principles

 Before designing/selecting any MMS, the nine [Principles for Digital
 Development](https://digitalprinciples.org/) should be considered.

###  Step 2: Which Types of Data to Consider?

 MMS software gathers data giving a better sense of the project's
 operational and maintenance needs. The type and volume of data to be
 inserted into the MMS are based on the project's complexity and can
 range from a small farm (tractors, plows, tills, seeds, fertilizer,
 etc.) to a hospital complex (beds, wheel-chairs, meals, light bulbs,
 drugs, masks, thermostats, blood bags, etc.).

 Some MMS ready-to-use solutions are configured with all the necessary
 base files, processes, reports, and data visualization dashboards,
 work orders, inventory requisition, contracts, vendors, roles and
 responsibilities, technical restrictions, textual data and
 georeferences, external systems to interact, and so on. One important
 information need lies in the regular upkeep of data collection and the
 careful weighing of dis-/advantages between decentralized (by each
 technician) vs. centralized (by an administrative assistant) data
 entry.

 The different components of an MMS include, but are not limited to:

 **Equipment data management:** equipment model number, serial number, equipment ID, purchase date, installation date,
 warranty, and spare parts information, such as part number,
 description, location, and pictures

 **Preventive maintenance:** cyclical maintenance scheduled on a
 regular basis to save on corrective maintenance, prolong the
 shelf-life of the device, and so on

 **Predictive maintenance:** occasional maintenance scheduled

 before a device is likely to fail, requiring a connection to sen- sors
 and increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze the
 information. AI can also track deviations early on, which is
 particularly handy in case of remote monitoring, to send tech- nicians
 timely information and avoid downtime.

 **Labor:** technician name, visits, date of repairs, and so on

 **Work order system:** required repairs are described and located for
 mobile teams to be sent out (e.g., scheduling/planning, vendor management, inventory
 control, purchasing, budgeting, and asset tracking)

 In many cases, an MMS has touchpoints or even interlinkages with other
 key hard/software technologies of the project. For example, an MMS
 could be connected via an intranet to an infra- structure smart sensor
 that measures whether external condi- tions allow operations and
 alerts in case material degrades, or maintenance data can flow into
 **asset investment planning and management (AIPM)** solutions, which
 help asset-intensive organizations' management decide where and when
 to invest in their businesses to optimize performance and manage risk.

### Step 3: What Information Do I Need?

 Maintenance workers, quality engineers, customer service, manu-
 facturers, and system administrators specifically rely on MMS to make
 inventory, effectively plan breakdown/preventive repairs, organize
 spare part storage management, support manage- ment's decision-making
 in cost allocation, and verify and keep track of regulatory
 compliance. Various sectors use MMS (manu- facturing,
 fleet/facilities/utilities/properties management, hospi- tality,
 healthcare, agriculture, food service, municipalities, energy,
 national parks, warehouses, mobility, etc.).

###  Step 4: Acquisition Options

 Sector- and/or infrastructure-type specific software is usually
 proprietory. It is in the PEA's interest to plan MMS from the onset of
 the project and include its purchase and expertise to use it in the
 project suppliers' terms of reference.

### What do I need to consider before acquiring MMS software?

 the **internal capacity** to channel and use the many data sources
 that may feed the MMS (sensors, spatial data, etc.) the **user
 adoption rate** (percentage of users sticking with an MMS app, number
 of work orders per technician, degree of autonomy between technician
 and supervisors).

 **cross-border dimension** with adaptations with regards to language,
 measurements, and time zone setup, among others.

## MMS uses
### In the building sector

-   Computer-Aided Facility Management (CAFM) systems for maintaining
    buildings such as hospitals or vocational training facilities

### In the water sector

-   **Water supply/wastewater disposal:** Maintenance of treatment plants (drinking water treatment,
 desalination, wastewater treatment plants) via computer-based systems

-   **Drinking water networks:** leakage repairs are made based on an
    MMS informing the repair teams via handheld systems (location of the
    repair, network details, etc.), data collection of all repairs to
    generate statistics and to generate the basis of rehabilitation
    measures in the network (time/type of mainte- nance, for example for
    valves, pipelines, and pumps).

### In the energy sector

-   SCADA power monitoring and control systems

### In the mobility sector

-   Road management systems
-   Bus stop maintenance systems
-   E-Mobility power charging systems
## Interoperability Requirements

 MMS software is usually used in connection with [Building Information Modeling](bim.md) (BIM) software, R/MIS and/or [Geospatial Information Systems](gis.md)
 (GIS).

 Thus, interoperability requirements are critical for smooth-running
 implementation. **Construction Operations Building information
 exchange** (COBie) is an international standard developed to improve the handover of facility data (BIM) and to support
 facility management systems.

## Legal Aspects

 **Data Security:** If a desktop software system is used, data security
 should be warranted by ensuring:

 that the data are protected against unauthorized or accidental
 destruction, accidental loss, technical defects, falsification, theft,
 unlawful use, unauthorized modification or duplication, and other
 forms of unauthorized access and use by appropri- ate technical means

 regular backup of data appropriate security of hardware

 If the software is provided as a web-based service (SaaS), the
 provider should be contractually obliged to take appropriate
 organizational and technical precautions to prevent disruptions to the
 availability, integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of their
 information technology systems, components, and processes that are
 essential to the functioning of the critical infrastructures they
 operate. The provider should implement data backup concepts, thereby
 ensuring the protection of data against loss due to system-related
 faults.

 **Data protection:** Wherever possible, the collection of personal
 data should be avoided. If this is impossible, the main principles of
 data protection must be adhered to, that is, personal data shall:

 be processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner

 only be used for a legitimate purpose in relation to the project be
 limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for the
 project

 be accurate and, where necessary, kept up-to-date not be kept longer
 than is necessary for the purposes of the project

 be securely stored, including protection against unauthorized or
 unlawful processing and against accidental loss

 If KfW (or persons acting on behalf of it) are (also) processing
 personal data, the privacy check in [RMMV Guidebook Section 2.3.1](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/Service/Publications-Videos/Publications-by-topic/Digitalisation/RMMV-Guidebook/) must be followed.

Since MMS tools allow **tracking of employees**, legal restrictions on the use of such tools may arise from applicable local laws. Some privacy laws will give discretion to
 employers as to how far they can go with their employee monitoring
 programs. In other cases, employers will have to inform employees who
 are likely to be monitored or even require employees to consent.
